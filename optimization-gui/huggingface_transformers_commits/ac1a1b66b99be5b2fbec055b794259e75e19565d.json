Use Transformers to fine-tune models on your data, build inference applications, and for generative AI use cases across multiple modalities.\n \n-These models can be applied on:\n+There are over 500K+ Transformers [model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers&sort=trending) on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.com/models) you can use.\n \n-* 📝 Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and text generation, in over 100 languages.\n-* 🖼️ Images, for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n-* 🗣️ Audio, for tasks like speech recognition and audio classification.\n+Explore the [Hub](https://huggingface.com/) today to find a model and use Transformers to help you get started right away.\n \n-Transformer models can also perform tasks on **several modalities combined**, such as table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.\n+## Installation\n \n-🤗 Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets and then share them with the community on our [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments.\n+Transformers works with Python 3.9+ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 2.0+, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) 2.6+, and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 0.4.1+.\n \n-🤗 Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries — [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) — with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other.\n+Create and activate a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Rust-based Python package and project manager.\n \n-## Online demos\n+```py\n+# venv\n+python -m venv my-env\n+source ./my-env/bin/activate\n \n-You can test most of our models directly on their pages from the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

The `Pipeline` is a high-level inference class that supports text, audio, vision, and multimodal tasks. It handles preprocessing the input and returns the appropriate output.\n \n-Transformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models: it's a community of projects built around it and the\n-Hugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone\n-else to build their dream projects.\n+Instantiate a pipeline and specify model to use for text generation. The model is downloaded and cached so you can easily reuse it again. Finally, pass some text to prompt the model.\n \n-In order to celebrate the 100,000 stars of transformers, we have decided to put the spotlight on the\n-community, and we have created the [awesome-transformers](./awesome-transformers.md) page which lists 100\n-incredible projects built in the vicinity of transformers.\n+```py\n+from transformers import pipeline\n \n-If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it!\n+pipeline = pipeline(task=\"text-generation\", model=\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B\")\n+pipeline(\"the secret to baking a really good cake is \")\n+[{'generated_text': 'the secret to baking a really good cake is 1) to use the right ingredients and 2) to follow the recipe exactly. the recipe for the cake is as follows: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips. if you want to make 2 cakes, how much sugar do you need? To make 2 cakes, you will need 2 cups of sugar.'}]\n+```\n \n-## Serious about AI in your organisation? Build faster with the Hugging Face Enterprise Hub.\n+To chat with a model, the usage pattern is the same. The only difference is you need to construct a chat history (the input to `Pipeline`) between you and the system.\n \n-<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/enterprise\">\n-    <img alt=\"Hugging Face Enterprise Hub\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/247fb16d-d251-4583-96c4-d3d76dda4925\">\n-</a><br>\n-\n-## Quick tour\n+> [!TIP]\n+> You can also chat with a model directly from the command line.\n+> ```shell\n+> transformers-cli chat --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\n+> ```\n \n-To immediately use a model on a given input (text, image, audio, ...), we provide the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model's training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts:\n+```py\n+import torch\n+from transformers import pipeline\n \n-```python\n->>> from transformers import pipeline\n+chat = [\n+    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a sassy, wise-cracking robot as imagined by Hollywood circa 1986.\"},\n+    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hey, can you tell me any fun things to do in New York?\"}\n+]\n \n-# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\n->>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n->>> classifier('We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.')\n-[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996980428695679}]\n+pipeline = pipeline(task=\"text-generation\", model=\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\")\n+response = pipeline(chat, max_new_tokens=512)\n+print(response[0][\"generated_text\"][-1][\"content\"])\n ```\n \n-The second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the third evaluates it on the given text. Here, the answer is \"positive\" with a confidence of 99.97%.\n-\n-Many tasks have a pre-trained `pipeline` ready to go, in NLP but also in computer vision and speech. For example, we can easily extract detected objects in an image:\n-\n-``` python\n->>> import requests\n->>> from PIL import Image\n->>> from transformers import pipeline\n-\n-# Download an image with cute cats\n->>> url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\"\n->>> image_data = requests.get(url, stream=True).raw\n->>> image = Image.open(image_data)\n-\n-# Allocate a pipeline for object detection\n->>> object_detector = pipeline('object-detection')\n->>> object_detector(image)\n-[{'score': 0.9982201457023621,\n-  'label': 'remote',\n-  'box': {'xmin': 40, 'ymin': 70, 'xmax': 175, 'ymax': 117}},\n- {'score': 0.9960021376609802,\n-  'label': 'remote',\n-  'box': {'xmin': 333, 'ymin': 72, 'xmax': 368, 'ymax': 187}},\n- {'score': 0.9954745173454285,\n-  'label': 'couch',\n-  'box': {'xmin': 0, 'ymin': 1, 'xmax': 639, 'ymax': 473}},\n- {'score': 0.9988006353378296,\n-  'label': 'cat',\n-  'box': {'xmin': 13, 'ymin': 52, 'xmax': 314, 'ymax': 470}},\n- {'score': 0.9986783862113953,\n-  'label': 'cat',\n-  'box': {'xmin': 345, 'ymin': 23, 'xmax': 640, 'ymax': 368}}]\n+Expand the examples below to see how `Pipeline` works for different modalities and tasks.\n+\n+<details>\n+<summary>Automatic speech recognition</summary>\n+\n+```py\n+from transformers import pipeline\n+\n+pipeline = pipeline(task=\"automatic-speech-recognition\", model=\"openai/whisper-large-v3\")\n+pipeline(\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/mlk.flac\")\n+{'text': ' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.'}\n ```\n \n-Here, we get a list of objects detected in the image, with a box surrounding the object and a confidence score.
