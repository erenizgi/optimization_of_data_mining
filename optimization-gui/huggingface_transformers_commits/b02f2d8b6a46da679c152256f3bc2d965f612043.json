It comprises 236B total parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token, and supports a context length of 128K tokens. DeepSeek-V2 adopts innovative architectures including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. MLA guarantees efficient inference through significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector, while DeepSeekMoE enables training strong models at an economical cost through sparse computation. Compared with DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 achieves significantly stronger performance, and meanwhile saves 42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum generation throughput to 5.76 times. We pretrain DeepSeek-V2 on a high-quality and multi-source corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens, and further perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fully unlock its potential. Evaluation results show that, even with only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 and its chat versions still achieve top-tier performance among open-source models."

In developing these models, we incorporated several key innovations aimed at improving the models' performances while reducing training costs:\n \n One pre-training: We conducted a single large-scale pretraining run on the 7B model, using 2048 H100 GPU chips, leveraging 14 trillion tokens featuring web, code, STEM, and curated high-quality and multilingual data.\n Depth up-scaling for improved reasoning: Building on recent studies on the effects of model depth, we upscaled the 7B model to a 10B parameters model by duplicating the redundant layers and continuing pre-training with 2TT of high-quality data. This yielded Falcon3-10B-Base which achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance for models under 13B parameters."

However, they were a little cumbersome as this requires often some changes during inference or finetuning. In this update/change, we continue training UL2 20B for an additional 100k steps (with small batch) to forget “mode tokens” before applying Flan instruction tuning. This Flan-UL2 checkpoint does not require mode tokens anymore.\n Google has released the following variants:\n \n-The original checkpoints can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-ul2-checkpoints).\n+The original checkpoints can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ul2).\n \n \n ## Running on low resource devices"

The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety. To support image recognition tasks, the Llama 3.2-Vision model uses a separately trained vision adapter that integrates with the pre-trained Llama 3.1 language model.

Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. Moshi also predicts time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. This “Inner Monologue” method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech and provides streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. As a result, Moshi is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice.\n "
