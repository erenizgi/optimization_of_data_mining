They either matched specific except blocks or were raised.\n\nAfter #36033, a catch-all except Exception block was introduced without a fallback else, causing unknown errors to be silently ignored and leading to misleading downstream behavior.\n\nThis commit adds an `else: raise e` to ensure only explicitly handled exceptions are suppressed. All others are surfaced, restoring pre-4.50 behavior and aiding in debugging and dependency visibility.\n\nCo-authored-by: Cyril Vallez <cyril.vallez@huggingface.co>",
