Despite this small scale, phi-1 attains pass@1 accuracy 50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP.\n-They follow the same strategy for Phi-1.5 and created another 1.3B parameter model with performance on natural language tasks comparable\n-to models 5x larger, and surpassing most non-frontier LLMs. Phi-1.5 exhibits many of the traits of much larger LLMs such as the ability\n-to “think step by step” or perform some rudimentary in-context learning.\n-With these two experiments the authors successfully showed the huge impact of quality of training data when training machine learning models.\n-\n-The abstract from the Phi-1 paper is the following:\n-\n-*We introduce phi-1, a new large language model for code, with significantly smaller size than\n-competing models: phi-1 is a Transformer-based model with 1.3B parameters, trained for 4 days on\n-8 A100s, using a selection of “textbook quality” data from the web (6B tokens) and synthetically\n-generated textbooks and exercises with GPT-3.5 (1B tokens). Despite this small scale, phi-1 attains\n-pass@1 accuracy 50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP. It also displays surprising emergent\n-properties compared to phi-1-base, our model before our finetuning stage on a dataset of coding\n-exercises, and phi-1-small, a smaller model with 350M parameters trained with the same pipeline as\n-phi-1 that still achieves 45% on HumanEval.*\n-\n-The abstract from the Phi-1.5 paper is the following:\n-\n-*We continue the investigation into the power of smaller Transformer-based language models as\n-initiated by TinyStories – a 10 million parameter model that can produce coherent English – and\n-the follow-up work on phi-1, a 1.3 billion parameter model with Python coding performance close\n-to the state-of-the-art. The latter work proposed to use existing Large Language Models (LLMs) to\n-generate “textbook quality” data as a way to enhance the learning process compared to traditional\n-web data. We follow the “Textbooks Are All You Need” approach, focusing this time on common\n-sense reasoning in natural language, and create a new 1.3 billion parameter model named phi-1.5,\n-with performance on natural language tasks comparable to models 5x larger, and surpassing most\n-non-frontier LLMs on more complex reasoning tasks such as grade-school mathematics and basic\n-coding. More generally, phi-1.5 exhibits many of the traits of much larger LLMs, both good –such\n-as the ability to “think step by step” or perform some rudimentary in-context learning– and bad,\n-including hallucinations and the potential for toxic and biased generations –encouragingly though, we\n-are seeing improvement on that front thanks to the absence of web data. We open-source phi-1.5 to\n-promote further research on these urgent topics.*\n-\n-This model was contributed by [Susnato Dhar](https://huggingface.co/susnato).\n-\n-The original code for Phi-1, Phi-1.5 and Phi-2 can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1), [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1_5) and [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2), respectively.\n-\n-## Usage tips\n-\n-- This model is quite similar to `Llama` with the main difference in [`PhiDecoderLayer`], where they used [`PhiAttention`] and [`PhiMLP`] layers in parallel configuration.\n-- The tokenizer used for this model is identical to the [`CodeGenTokenizer`].\n-\n-## How to use Phi-2\n-\n-<Tip warning={true}>\n+# Phi\n \n-Phi-2 has been integrated in the development version (4.37.0.dev) of `transformers`. Until the official version is released through `pip`, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\n+[Phi](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.11644) is a 1.3B parameter transformer model optimized for Python code generation. It focuses on \"textbook-quality\" training data of code examples, exercises and synthetic Python problems rather than scaling the model size or compute.\n \n-* When loading the model, ensure that `trust_remote_code=True` is passed as an argument of the `from_pretrained()` function.\n+You can find all the original Phi checkpoints under the [Phi-1](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-1-6626e29134744e94e222d572) collection.\n \n-* Update your local `transformers` to the development version: `pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers`. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\n+> [!TIP]\n+> Click on the Phi models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply Phi to different language tasks.\n \n-</Tip>\n+The example below demonstrates how to generate text with [`Pipeline`], [`AutoModel`] and from the command line.\n \n-```python\n->>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n+<hfoptions id=\"usage\">\n+<hfoption id=\"Pipeline\">\n \n->>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\")\n->>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\")\n+```py\n+import torch\n+from transformers import pipeline\n \n->>> inputs = tokenizer('Can you help me write a formal email to a potential business partner proposing a joint venture?', return_tensors=\"pt\", return_attention_mask=False)\n+pipeline = pipeline(task=\"text-generation\", model=\"microsoft/phi-1.5\", device=0, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\n+pipeline(\"pipeline('''def print_prime(n): \"\"\" Print all primes between 1 and n\"\"\"''')\")\n \n->>> outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=30)\n->>> text = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0]\n->>> print(text)\n-Can you help me write a formal email to a potential business partner proposing a joint venture?\n-Input: Company A: ABC Inc.\n-Company B\n ```\n \n-### Example :\n-\n-```python\n->>> from transformers import PhiForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n+</hfoption>\n \n->>> # define the model and tokenizer.\n->>> model = PhiForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\")\n->>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\")\n+<hfoption id=\"AutoModel\">\n \n->>> # feel free to change the prompt to your liking.\n->>> prompt = \"If I were an AI that had just achieved\"\n+```py\n+import torch\n+from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n \n->>> # apply the tokenizer.\n->>> tokens = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n+tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1\")\n+model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1\", torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map=\"auto\", attn_implementation=\"sdpa\")\n \n->>> # use the model to generate new tokens.\n->>> generated_output = model.generate(**tokens, use_cache=True, max_new_tokens=10)\n+input_ids = tokenizer('''def print_prime(n):\n+   \"\"\"\n+   Print all primes between 1 and n\n+   \"\"\"''', return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n \n->>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_output)[0]\n-'If I were an AI that had just achieved a breakthrough in machine learning, I would be thrilled'\n+output = model.generate(**input_ids, cache_implementation=\"static\")\n+print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n ```\n \n-## Combining Phi and Flash Attention 2\n-\n-First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2 to include the sliding window attention feature.\n+</hfoption>\n+<hfoption id=\"transformers-cli\">\n \n ```bash\n-pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation\n+echo -e \"'''def print_prime(n): \"\"\" Print all primes between 1 and n\"\"\"'''\" | transformers-cli run --task text-classification --model microsoft/phi-1.5 --device 0\n ```\n \n-Make also sure that you have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2.
