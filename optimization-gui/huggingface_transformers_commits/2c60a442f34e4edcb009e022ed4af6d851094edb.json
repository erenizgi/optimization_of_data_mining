For autoregressive models, KV scores are calculated *every* time because the model predicts one token at a time. Each prediction depends on the previous tokens, which means the model performs the same computations each time.\n \n-A KV *cache* stores these calculations so they can be reused without recomputing them.

Some of these [`Cache`] classes are optimized to save memory while others are designed to maximize generation speed.
