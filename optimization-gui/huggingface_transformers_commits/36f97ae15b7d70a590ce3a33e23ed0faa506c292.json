It introduces techniques like residual-post-norm combined with cosine attention for improved training stability, log-spaced continuous position bias to better handle varying image resolutions between pre-training and fine-tuning, and a new pre-training method (SimMIM) to reduce the need for large amounts of labeled data. These improvements enable efficiently training very large models (up to 3 billion parameters) capable of processing high-resolution images.\n+\n+You can find official Swin Transformer V2 checkpoints under the [Microsoft](https://huggingface.co/microsoft?search_models=swinv2) organization.\n+\n+> [!TIP]\n+> Click on the Swin Transformer V2 models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply Swin Transformer V2 to vision tasks.\n+\n+<hfoptions id=\"usage\">\n+<hfoption id=\"Pipeline\">\n \n-## Overview\n+```py\n+import torch\n+from transformers import pipeline\n \n-The Swin Transformer V2 model was proposed in [Swin Transformer V2: Scaling Up Capacity and Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883) by Ze Liu, Han Hu, Yutong Lin, Zhuliang Yao, Zhenda Xie, Yixuan Wei, Jia Ning, Yue Cao, Zheng Zhang, Li Dong, Furu Wei, Baining Guo.\n+pipeline = pipeline(\n+    task=\"image-classification\",\n+    model=\"microsoft/swinv2-tiny-patch4-window8-256\",\n+    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n+    device=0\n+)\n+pipeline(images=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg\")\n+```\n \n-The abstract from the paper is the following:\n+</hfoption>\n \n-*Large-scale NLP models have been shown to significantly improve the performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings. This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision models, including training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and makes it capable of training with images of up to 1,536×1,536 resolution. It set new performance records on 4 representative vision tasks, including ImageNet-V2 image classification, COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less training time.*\n+<hfoption id=\"AutoModel\">\n \n-This model was contributed by [nandwalritik](https://huggingface.co/nandwalritik).\n-The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer).\n+```py\n+import torch\n+import requests\n+from PIL import Image\n+from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification, AutoImageProcessor\n \n-## Resources\n+image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\n+    \"microsoft/swinv2-tiny-patch4-window8-256\",\n+)\n+model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(\n+    \"microsoft/swinv2-tiny-patch4-window8-256\",\n+    device_map=\"auto\"\n+)\n \n-A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with Swin Transformer v2.\n+url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg\"\n+image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n+inputs = image_processor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n \n-<PipelineTag pipeline=\"image-classification\"/>\n+with torch.no_grad():\n+  logits = model(**inputs).logits\n \n-- [`Swinv2ForImageClassification`] is supported by this [example script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/image-classification) and [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_classification.ipynb).\n-- See also: [Image classification task guide](../tasks/image_classification)\n+predicted_class_id = logits.argmax(dim=-1).item()\n+predicted_class_label = model.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]\n+print(f\"The predicted class label is: {predicted_class_label}\")\n+```\n \n-Besides that:\n+</hfoption>\n+</hfoptions>\n \n-- [`Swinv2ForMaskedImageModeling`] is supported by this [example script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/image-pretraining).\n+## Notes\n \n-If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.\n+- Swin Transformer V2 can pad the inputs for any input height and width divisible by `32`. \n+- Swin Transformer V2 can be used as a [backbone](../backbones). When `output_hidden_states = True`, it outputs both `hidden_states` and `reshaped_hidden_states`. The `reshaped_hidden_states` have a shape of `(batch, num_channels, height, width)` rather than `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_channels)`.\n \n ## Swinv2Config\n "
