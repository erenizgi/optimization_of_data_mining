These libraries are specifically designed to optimize performance with LLMs and include many unique optimization features that may not be included in Transformers.\n+\n+## TGI\n+\n+[TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) can serve models that aren't [natively implemented](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/supported_models) by falling back on the Transformers implementation of the model. Some of TGIs high-performance features aren't available in the Transformers implementation, but other features like continuous batching and streaming are still supported.\n+\n+> [!TIP]\n+> Refer to the [Non-core model serving](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/basic_tutorials/non_core_models) guide for more details.\n+\n+Serve a Transformers implementation the same way you'd serve a TGI model.\n+\n+```docker\n+docker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:latest --model-id gpt2\n+```\n+\n+Add `--trust-remote_code` to the command to serve a custom Transformers model.\n+\n+```docker\n+docker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:latest --model-id <CUSTOM_MODEL_ID> --trust-remote-code\n+```\n+\n+## vLLM\n+\n+[vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) can also serve a Transformers implementation of a model if it isn't [natively implemented](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html#list-of-text-only-language-models) in vLLM.\n+\n+Many features like quantization, LoRA adapters, and distributed inference and serving are supported for the Transformers implementation.\n+\n+> [!TIP]\n+> Refer to the [Transformers fallback](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html#transformers-fallback) section for more details.\n+\n+By default, vLLM serves the native implementation and if it doesn't exist, it falls back on the Transformers implementation.
