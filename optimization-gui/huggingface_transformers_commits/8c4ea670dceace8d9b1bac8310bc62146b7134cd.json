Our approach streamlines the\n-detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression\n-procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the\n-new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via\n-bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries,\n-DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of\n-predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many\n-other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and\n-highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily\n-generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive\n-baselines.*\n+</hfoption>\n+<hfoption id=\"AutoModel\">\n \n-This model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr).

Let's assume we also add a batch dimension. This means that the input to the backbone is a\n-tensor of shape `(batch_size, 3, height, width)`, assuming the image has 3 color channels (RGB). The CNN backbone\n-outputs a new lower-resolution feature map, typically of shape `(batch_size, 2048, height/32, width/32)`. This is\n-then projected to match the hidden dimension of the Transformer of DETR, which is `256` by default, using a\n-`nn.Conv2D` layer. So now, we have a tensor of shape `(batch_size, 256, height/32, width/32).` Next, the\n-feature map is flattened and transposed to obtain a tensor of shape `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)` =\n-`(batch_size, width/32*height/32, 256)`. So a difference with NLP models is that the sequence length is actually\n-longer than usual, but with a smaller `d_model` (which in NLP is typically 768 or higher).\n-\n-Next, this is sent through the encoder, outputting `encoder_hidden_states` of the same shape (you can consider\n-these as image features). Next, so-called **object queries** are sent through the decoder. This is a tensor of shape\n-`(batch_size, num_queries, d_model)`, with `num_queries` typically set to 100 and initialized with zeros.\n-These input embeddings are learnt positional encodings that the authors refer to as object queries, and similarly to\n-the encoder, they are added to the input of each attention layer. Each object query will look for a particular object\n-in the image. The decoder updates these embeddings through multiple self-attention and encoder-decoder attention layers\n-to output `decoder_hidden_states` of the same shape: `(batch_size, num_queries, d_model)`. Next, two heads\n-are added on top for object detection: a linear layer for classifying each object query into one of the objects or \"no\n-object\", and a MLP to predict bounding boxes for each query.\n-\n-The model is trained using a **bipartite matching loss**: so what we actually do is compare the predicted classes +\n-bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N\n-(so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a \"no object\" as class and \"no bounding box\" as\n-bounding box). The [Hungarian matching algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) is used to find\n-an optimal one-to-one mapping of each of the N queries to each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for\n-the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and [generalized IoU loss](https://giou.stanford.edu/) (for the\n-bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.\n-\n-DETR can be naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation (which unifies semantic segmentation and instance\n-segmentation). [`~transformers.DetrForSegmentation`] adds a segmentation mask head on top of\n-[`~transformers.DetrForObjectDetection`]. The mask head can be trained either jointly, or in a two steps process,\n-where one first trains a [`~transformers.DetrForObjectDetection`] model to detect bounding boxes around both\n-\"things\" (instances) and \"stuff\" (background things like trees, roads, sky), then freeze all the weights and train only\n-the mask head for 25 epochs. Experimentally, these two approaches give similar results. Note that predicting boxes is\n-required for the training to be possible, since the Hungarian matching is computed using distances between boxes.\n-\n-## Usage tips\n-\n-- DETR uses so-called **object queries** to detect objects in an image. The number of queries determines the maximum\n-  number of objects that can be detected in a single image, and is set to 100 by default (see parameter\n-  `num_queries` of [`~transformers.DetrConfig`]). Note that it's good to have some slack (in COCO, the\n-  authors used 100, while the maximum number of objects in a COCO image is ~70).\n-- The decoder of DETR updates the query embeddings in parallel. This is different from language models like GPT-2,\n-  which use autoregressive decoding instead of parallel. Hence, no causal attention mask is used.\n-- DETR adds position embeddings to the hidden states at each self-attention and cross-attention layer before projecting\n-  to queries and keys. For the position embeddings of the image, one can choose between fixed sinusoidal or learned\n-  absolute position embeddings. By default, the parameter `position_embedding_type` of\n-  [`~transformers.DetrConfig`] is set to `\"sine\"`.\n-- During training, the authors of DETR did find it helpful to use auxiliary losses in the decoder, especially to help\n-  the model output the correct number of objects of each class. If you set the parameter `auxiliary_loss` of\n-  [`~transformers.DetrConfig`] to `True`, then prediction feedforward neural networks and Hungarian losses\n-  are added after each decoder layer (with the FFNs sharing parameters).\n-- If you want to train the model in a distributed environment across multiple nodes, then one should update the\n-  _num_boxes_ variable in the _DetrLoss_ class of _modeling_detr.py_. When training on multiple nodes, this should be\n-  set to the average number of target boxes across all nodes, as can be seen in the original implementation [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr/blob/a54b77800eb8e64e3ad0d8237789fcbf2f8350c5/models/detr.py#L227-L232).\n-- [`~transformers.DetrForObjectDetection`] and [`~transformers.DetrForSegmentation`] can be initialized with\n-  any convolutional backbone available in the [timm library](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models).\n-  Initializing with a MobileNet backbone for example can be done by setting the `backbone` attribute of\n-  [`~transformers.DetrConfig`] to `\"tf_mobilenetv3_small_075\"`, and then initializing the model with that\n-  config.\n-- DETR resizes the input images such that the shortest side is at least a certain amount of pixels while the longest is\n-  at most 1333 pixels. At training time, scale augmentation is used such that the shortest side is randomly set to at\n-  least 480 and at most 800 pixels. At inference time, the shortest side is set to 800. One can use\n-  [`~transformers.DetrImageProcessor`] to prepare images (and optional annotations in COCO format) for the\n-  model. Due to this resizing, images in a batch can have different sizes. DETR solves this by padding images up to the\n-  largest size in a batch, and by creating a pixel mask that indicates which pixels are real/which are padding.\n-  Alternatively, one can also define a custom `collate_fn` in order to batch images together, using\n-  [`~transformers.DetrImageProcessor.pad_and_create_pixel_mask`].\n-- The size of the images will determine the amount of memory being used, and will thus determine the `batch_size`.\n-  It is advised to use a batch size of 2 per GPU.
