It introduces convolutional layers into the vision transformer architecture, allowing it to capture local patterns in images while maintaining the global context provided by self-attention mechanisms.\n \n-## Overview\n+You can find all the CvT checkpoints under the [Microsoft](https://huggingface.co/microsoft?search_models=cvt) organization.\n \n-The CvT model was proposed in [CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers](https://huggingface.co/papers/2103.15808) by Haiping Wu, Bin Xiao, Noel Codella, Mengchen Liu, Xiyang Dai, Lu Yuan and Lei Zhang. The Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) improves the [Vision Transformer (ViT)](vit) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs.\n+> [!TIP]\n+> This model was contributed by [anujunj](https://huggingface.co/anugunj).\n+> \n+> Click on the CvT models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply CvT to different computer vision tasks.\n \n-The abstract from the paper is the following:\n+The example below demonstrates how to classify an image with [`Pipeline`] or the [`AutoModel`] class.\n \n-*We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) \n-in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through \n-two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer \n-block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) \n-to the ViT architecture (\\ie shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (\\ie dynamic attention, \n-global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves \n-state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, \n-performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (\\eg ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on \n-ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7\\% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, \n-a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.*\n+<hfoptions id=\"usage\">\n+<hfoption id=\"Pipeline\">\n \n-This model was contributed by [anugunj](https://huggingface.co/anugunj).
