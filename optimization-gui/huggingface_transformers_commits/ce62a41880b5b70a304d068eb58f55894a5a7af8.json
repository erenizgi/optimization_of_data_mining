These keypoints, also known as landmarks, represent meaningful features of objects, such as facial features or object parts. These models take an image input and return the following outputs: \n+\n+- **Keypoints and Scores**: Points of interest and their confidence scores.\n+- **Descriptors**: A representation of the image region surrounding each keypoint, capturing its texture, gradient, orientation and other properties.\n+\n+In this guide, we will show how to extract keypoints from images.\n+\n+For this tutorial, we will use [SuperPoint](./model_doc/superpoint.md), a foundation model for keypoint detection.\n+\n+```python\n+from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, SuperPointForKeypointDetection\n+processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\"magic-leap-community/superpoint\")\n+model = SuperPointForKeypointDetection.from_pretrained(\"magic-leap-community/superpoint\")\n+```\n+\n+Let's test the model on the images below.\n+\n+<div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\">\n+    <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/bee.jpg\" \n+         alt=\"Bee\" \n+         style=\"height: 200px; object-fit: contain; margin-right: 10px;\">\n+    <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/cats.png\" \n+         alt=\"Cats\" \n+         style=\"height: 200px; object-fit: contain;\">\n+</div>\n+\n+\n+```python\n+import torch\n+from PIL import Image\n+import requests\n+import cv2\n+\n+\n+url_image_1 = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/bee.jpg\"\n+image_1 = Image.open(requests.get(url_image_1, stream=True).raw)\n+url_image_2 = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/cats.png\"\n+image_2 = Image.open(requests.get(url_image_2, stream=True).raw)\n+\n+images = [image_1, image_2]\n+```\n+\n+We can now process our inputs and infer.\n+\n+```python\n+inputs = processor(images,return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device, model.dtype)\n+outputs = model(**inputs)\n+```\n+\n+The model output has relative keypoints, descriptors, masks and scores for each item in the batch.
