Howard, Menglong Zhu, Bo Chen, Dmitry Kalenichenko, Weijun Wang, Tobias Weyand, Marco Andreetto, Hartwig Adam.\n+[MobileNet V1](https://huggingface.co/papers/1704.04861) is a family of efficient convolutional neural networks optimized for on-device or embedded vision tasks. It achieves this efficiency by using depth-wise separable convolutions instead of standard convolutions. The architecture allows for easy trade-offs between latency and accuracy using two main hyperparameters, a width multiplier (alpha) and an image resolution multiplier.\n \n-The abstract from the paper is the following:\n+You can all the original MobileNet checkpoints under the [Google](https://huggingface.co/google?search_models=mobilenet) organization.\n \n-*We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.*\n+> [!TIP]\n+> Click on the MobileNet V1 models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply MobileNet to different vision tasks.\n \n-This model was contributed by [matthijs](https://huggingface.co/Matthijs).

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.*\n+# MobileNet V2\n \n-*The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters.*\n+[MobileNet V2](https://huggingface.co/papers/1801.04381) improves performance on mobile devices with a more efficient architecture. It uses inverted residual blocks and linear bottlenecks to start with a smaller representation of the data, expands it for processing, and shrinks it again to reduce the number of computations. The model also removes non-linearities to maintain accuracy despite its simplified design.
