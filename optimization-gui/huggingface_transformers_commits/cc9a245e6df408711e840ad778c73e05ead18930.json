Check out the [announcement](https://huggingface.co/blog/community-update) of this feature for more details 🤗.\n-\n-### What happened to the model cards here?\n-\n-We migrated every model card from the repo to its corresponding huggingface.co model repo. Individual commits were preserved, and they link back to the original commit on GitHub."
