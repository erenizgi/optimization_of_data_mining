We provide multiple classes implementing different partitioning\n+strategies and a simple entrypoint to parallelize `nn.Module` instance. You won't have to interact with this interface directly, everything is done in `PretrainedModel.from_pretrained` method for you.

Also supports Python implementation of `RMSNorm` (see [this](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/model.py#L34))\n+4) `PackedColwiseParallel` - A variant of column-wise partitioning, however it works on packed weights (i.e. `up_proj` and `gate_proj` being packed together). For more details, see [this comment](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/integrations/tensor_parallel.py#L79-#L108)\n+5) `PackedRowwiseParallel` - A variant of row-wise partitioning, works on packed weights, for more details check the comment linked above.\n+6) `GatherParallel` - A very simple class, that only makes the outputs of the module to be gathered across devices.\n+7) `IsolatedParallel` - This is a special case, where we want to *isolate* the module from the rest of the devices (world). This is used for Experts in MoE layers, basically creating Expert parallelism of sorts.\n+8) `ReplicateParallel` - Many `torch.distributed` APIs break if model is partially sharded, so this class is used to replicate the module across all devices.\n+\n+### Sharding a model\n+\n+We provide two ways to shard a model, first one is to use `auto` tensor parallelism plan, which will automatically shard the model based on our predefined configuration. This requires the model to have predefined tensor parallel plan in transformers.\n+\n+```python\n+from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\n+\n+# model_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\" # better for smaller number of GPUs\n+model_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct\" # better to visualize all the possible strategies\n+\n+model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, tp_plan=\"auto\")\n+\n+print(model._tp_plan)\n+```\n+\n+> [!TIP]\n+> For a list of models that support tensor parallelism, see the [Supported models](#supported-models) section above.\n+\n+The second way is to manually specify your own partitioning plan.\n+\n+```python\n+from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\n+\n+tp_plan = {\n+    \"model.layers.*.self_attn.q_proj\": \"colwise\",\n+    \"model.layers.*.self_attn.k_proj\": \"colwise\",\n+    \"model.layers.*.self_attn.v_proj\": \"colwise\",\n+    \"model.layers.*.self_attn.o_proj\": \"rowwise\",\n+    ...\n+}\n+\n+model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, tp_plan=tp_plan)\n+\n+print(model._tp_plan)\n+```\n+\n+You might have noticed that there are some special cases in the `ParallelInterface` mapping, let's now talk about them.

Weight packing is a common technique used in models. It's a technique where we pack multiple linear layers into a single, bigger one.\n+\n+For example in `Llama4` model, we pack `up_proj` and `gate_proj` into a single `gate_up_proj` module.\n+```python\n+class Llama4TextExperts(nn.Module):\n+    ...\n+    self.gate_up_proj = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(self.num_experts, self.hidden_size, 2 * self.expert_dim))\n+```\n+\n+Then in forward, we can use batch matrix multiplication to compute the output of the `gate_up_proj` module.\n+\n+```python\n+def forward(self, hidden_states):\n+    ...\n+    gate_up = torch.bmm(hidden_states, self.gate_up_proj) # Compute the output of the gate_up_proj module\n+    gate, up = gate_up.chunk(2, dim=-1) # Split the output into gate and up\n+```\n+\n+In this case, we need to use the `PackedRowwiseParallel` strategy to shard the `gate_up_proj` module, as using a simple `RowwiseParallel` will shard the layers wrongly.\n+\n+> [!TIP]\n+> If this is a bit difficult to wrap your head around, check out [this comment](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/integrations/tensor_parallel.py#L79-#L108) for an amazing visual representation of why `Packed*` needs to be used.\n+\n+\n+### `local*` strategies\n+\n+You could have noticed that there are `local*` strategies, which use the same layers as `*` strategy, but don't use `DTensor` at all.\n+This is because `DTensor` is not supported for some of the operations: such as `torch.chunk`.

Again, refer to the [Ultra-Scale Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook?section=tensor_parallelism) which can teach you everything required.\n+\n+### Extending the interface with your own partitioning strategies\n+\n+This is a very advanced topic, which requires a good understanding of distributed collectives and the model architecture.\n+Your custom partitioning strategy should inherit from `TensorParallelLayer` defined in [integrations/tensor_parallel.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/integrations/tensor_parallel.py) and implement: `partition_tensor`, `_prepare_input_fn` and `_prepare_output_fn`. Then it should be registered in the `ParallelInterface` mapping, so our dispatching logic can find it when specified in the `tp_plan`.\n+\n+Let's go through this workflow step by step, on an already existing example: `ColwiseParallel`.\n+\n+1) Inherit from `TensorParallelLayer` and initialization\n+\n+```python\n+class ColwiseParallel(TensorParallelLayer):\n+    def __init__(\n+        self,\n+        *,\n+        input_layouts: Optional[Placement] = None, # The input layout coming from the previous layer\n+        output_layouts: Optional[Placement] = None, # The output layout we want to achieve\n+        use_local_output: bool = True, # Whether to use local output or not\n+        use_dtensor=True, # Whether to use DTensor or not\n+    ):\n+        self.input_layouts = (input_layouts or Replicate(),) # The input sharding coming from the previous layer\n+        self.output_layouts = (output_layouts or Shard(-1),) # Desired output sharding\n+        self.desired_input_layouts = (Replicate(),) # Desired input sharding, inputs should be replicated across GPUs\n+        self.use_local_output = use_local_output\n+        self.use_dtensor = use_dtensor\n+```\n+\n+In the `__init__` method, we define these attributes, where `input_layouts` and `output_layouts` describing, how the input and output tensors should be placed on the devices. `desired_input_layouts` is used to specify, how the input *SHOULD* be placed on the devices.\n+\n+2a) Implement `partition_tensor` method\n+\n+```python\n+def partition_tensor(\n+    self,\n+    param, # Full tensor of the parameter\n+    empty_param, # Empty tensor of the parameter, will be filled with the partitioned tensor\n+    param_type, # Type of the parameter, `bias` or `weight`\n+    param_casting_dtype, # The type to cast the parameter to\n+    to_contiguous, # Whether to convert the tensor to a contiguous memory layout\n+    rank, # The rank of the current device\n+    device_mesh, # The device mesh\n+) -> nn.Parameter: # Return the partitioned parameter\n+    ...\n+```\n+\n+This method is used to partition the tensor, and fill the `empty_param` with the partitioned tensor.\n+We provide some utility functions to help you with this, such as `get_tensor_shard` which will get you the correct shard of the original parameter for this rank or `get_packed_weights` to help with packed weights.\n+\n+2b) Implement `_prepare_input_fn` and `_prepare_output_fn` methods\n+\n+These methods are used as [`pre-forward`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.modules.module.register_module_forward_pre_hook.html) and [`forward`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.modules.module.register_module_forward_hook.html) hooks respectively.

We heavily utilize abstractions such as `DeviceMesh` or `DTensor` to provide a simple and extensible interface to the user.\n+\n+### DeviceMesh\n+Imagine `DeviceMesh` as a multi-dimensional grid of devices that communicate together. Different parallelization strategies require different types of communication patterns, therefore we can create a `DeviceMesh` with multiple submeshes:\n+```python\n+from torch.distributed.device_mesh import init_device_mesh\n+\n+# Create a 1D mesh of 4 GPUs\n+device_mesh = init_device_mesh(\"cuda\", (4,), mesh_dim_names=[\"tp\"])\n+```\n+Then, most of the `torch.distributed` defined parallelization strategies can be applied to a mesh itself, or its submesh, automatically handling the communication patterns.\n+\n+### DTensor\n+\n+Abbreviation for Distributed Tensor, `DTensor` is a tensor subclass that handles the distributed logic on-top of the usual tensor operations. Most of the model weights in case of tensor parallelism are stored as `DTensor`s (with some exceptions, more on that later).\n+The most important part of DTensor, that is crucial to understand, is the `placement` attribute. It's an attribute that tells PyTorch how is the tensor placed on the devices of the `DeviceMesh`.\n+\n+It can have the following values:\n+\n+1) `Shard(dimension)` - Annotates that this `DTensor` is sharded across a given dimension, over the `DeviceMesh` it was constructed under. For example, if we would like to shard weights for column-wise partitioning, we would do:\n+```python\n+weight = ...\n+weight = DTensor.from_local(weight, device_mesh[\"tp\"], placements=[Shard(0)]) # Shard across the 1st (column-wise) dimension\n+bias = ...\n+bias = DTensor.from_local(bias, device_mesh[\"tp\"], placements=[Shard(-1)]) # Shard across the ONLY dimension\n+```\n+\n+To give another example, for row-wise partitioning, we would do:\n+```python\n+weight = ...\n+weight = DTensor.from_local(weight, device_mesh[\"tp\"], placements=[Shard(1)]) # Shard across the 2nd (row-wise) dimension\n+bias = ...\n+bias = DTensor.from_local(bias, device_mesh[\"tp\"], placements=[Replicate()]) # Replicate bias across all GPUs\n+```\n+\n+2) `Replicate()` - Annotates that this `DTensor` is replicated across the `DeviceMesh`. Very straight-forward, only creates a full copy of the tensor on each device.\n+3) `Partial()` - This placement is mostly of no interest to us, it's used to annotate that this tensor is pending a reduction operation.\n+\n+You can find definitions for all of the different partitioning schemes in [integrations/tensor_parallel.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/integrations/tensor_parallel.py).\n </div>"
