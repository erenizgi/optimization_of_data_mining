This approach focuses on learning semantic features without relying on pre-defined invariances from hand-crafted data transformations, which can bias specific tasks, or on filling in pixel-level details, which often leads to less meaningful representations.\n \n The abstract from the paper is the following:\n \n This paper demonstrates an approach for learning highly semantic image representations without relying on hand-crafted data-augmentations. We introduce the Image- based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA), a non-generative approach for self-supervised learning from images. The idea behind I-JEPA is simple: from a single context block, predict the representations of various target blocks in the same image. A core design choice to guide I-JEPA towards producing semantic representations is the masking strategy; specifically, it is crucial to (a) sample tar- get blocks with sufficiently large scale (semantic), and to (b) use a sufficiently informative (spatially distributed) context block. Empirically, when combined with Vision Transform- ers, we find I-JEPA to be highly scalable. For instance, we train a ViT-Huge/14 on ImageNet using 16 A100 GPUs in under 72 hours to achieve strong downstream performance across a wide range of tasks, from linear classification to object counting and depth prediction.\n \n+<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/ijepa_architecture.jpg\"\n+alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n+\n+<small> I-JEPA architecture.
