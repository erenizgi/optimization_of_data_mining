It is a State Space Model similar to Mamba 1, with better performances in a simplified architecture. \n+hfoptions id=\"usage\">\n+<hfoption id=\"Pipeline\">\n+\n+```python\n+import torch\n+from transformers import pipeline\n \n+pipeline = pipeline(\n+    task=\"text-generation\",\n+    model=\"mistralai/Mamba-Codestral-7B-v0.1\",\n+    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n+    device=0\n+)\n+pipeline(\"Plants create energy through a process known as\")\n+```\n \n-The abstract from the paper is the following:\n+</hfoption>\n+<hfoption id=\"AutoModel\">\n \n-*While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.*\n+```python\n+import torch  \n+from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer  \n \n-Tips:\n+tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"mistralai/Mamba-Codestral-7B-v0.1\")\n+model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"mistralai/Mamba-Codestral-7B-v0.1\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\")  \n+input_ids = tokenizer(\"Plants create energy through a process known as\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")  \n \n-This version should support all implementations of Mamba 2, and in particular [Mamba-2 codestral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mamba-Codestral-7B-v0.1) from Mistral AI. In particular, mamba 2 codestral was released with a number of `groups` equal to 8, which can be thought intuitively as similar to the number of kv heads in an attention-based model. \n-This model has two different forward passes, `torch_forward` or `cuda_kernels_forward`. The latter uses the original cuda kernels if they are found in your environment, and is slower on the prefill i.e. requires a \"warmup run\" due to high cpu overhead, see [here](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/issues/389#issuecomment-2171755306) and [also here](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/issues/355#issuecomment-2147597457). Without compilation, the `torch_forward` implementation is faster by a factor 3 to 4. Further, there are no positional embeddings in this model, but there is an `attention_mask` and a specific logic to mask out hidden states in two places in the case of batched generation, see [here](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/issues/66#issuecomment-1863563829) as well. Due to this, in addition to the reimplementation of mamba2 kernels, batched generation and cached generation are expected to have slight discrepancies. Further, the results given by the cuda kernels or the torch forward are expected to be slightly different. The SSM algorithm heavily relies on tensor contractions, which have matmul equivalents but the order of operations is slightly different, making the difference greater at smaller precisions. \n-Another note, shutdown of hidden states corresponding to padding tokens is done in 2 places and mostly has been tested with left-padding. Right-padding will propagate noise down the line and is not guaranteed to yield satisfactory results. `tokenizer.padding_side = \"left\"` ensures you are using the correct padding side.\n+output = model.generate(**input_ids)  \n+print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n+```\n \n-This model was contributed by [Molbap](https://huggingface.co/Molbap), with tremendous help from [Anton Vlasjuk](https://github.com/vasqu).\n-The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba).\n+</hfoption>\n+<hfoption id=\"transformers CLI\">\n \n+```bash\n+echo -e \"Plants create energy through a process known as\" | transformers-cli run --task text-generation --model mistralai/Mamba-Codestral-7B-v0.1 --device 0\n+```\n \n-# Usage\n+</hfoption>\n+</hfoptions>\n \n-### A simple generation example: \n-```python \n-from transformers import Mamba2Config, Mamba2ForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n+Quantization reduces the memory burden of large models by representing the weights in a lower precision.
