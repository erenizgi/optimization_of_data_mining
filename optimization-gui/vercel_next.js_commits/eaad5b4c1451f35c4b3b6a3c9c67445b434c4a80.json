    "message": "Enable prettier for turbopack (#78559)\n\nEnable prettier for turbopack\n\nWhile the majority of the javascript in turbopack is for tests, this code is generally hand authored so prettier will help us.  There are also core parts of turbopack implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript so a formatter will help.\n\nThis was done by simply fixing prettier ignore and chasing lint errors.  There were a few fun issues\n\n* We had a test file called `won't-run-tla.js` and this triggered a bug in our eslint precommit hook.  The simplest thing was to simply drop the `'` character so that is what i did.  I spent a small amount of time trying to narrow this down't in the `lint-staged` dependency but failed, so i think the problem is probably in `eslint`, but it isn't really clear.\n* We had another test exercising `import.meta` but in a file called `.cjs`, which prettier rejects due its default `babel` parser.  So i excluded this from prettier.",
