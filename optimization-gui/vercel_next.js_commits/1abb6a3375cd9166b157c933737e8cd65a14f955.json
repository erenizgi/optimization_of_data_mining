    "message": "fix: Combine the hrtime tuple to get a better seconds representation (#82687)\n\nWhen building w/ webpack to calculate duration, we use `process.hrtime`\nwhich is a tuple of integers [seconds, nanoseconds] - which means that\nfor sub second compiler runs, we end up showing total 0ms, or 1000ms (I\nthink)\n\n- https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processhrtimetime\n\nWith this PR we combine the seconds and nanoseconds into a float. \n\n### Before:\n\n```console\n   ▲ Next.js 15.4.6\n   - Environments: .env.production\n\n   Creating an optimized production build ...\n ✓ Compiled successfully in 0ms\n   Skipping validation of types\n```\n\n### After\n\n```console\n   ▲ Next.js 15.4.6\n   - Environments: .env.production\n\n   Creating an optimized production build ...\n ✓ Compiled successfully in 813ms\n   Skipping validation of types\n```",
