I see that because\nthere is no new network request when I change route. In setting the\ncache option to no-store, it is making a new network request as soon as\ni get back to the page.\n\nso docs and real working one are mismatch.\n\nI also provided how tested with pictures belows.\nPlease build... and check\nChange routes...\n\n<img width=\"545\" height=\"371\" alt=\"image\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4931302f-b5ef-4016-b43d-cbbd790c1e11\"\n/>\n\n<img width=\"601\" height=\"409\" alt=\"image\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f2b4a79-fa24-466f-8330-0dc8323b6c16\"\n/>\n\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/83146\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Joseph <joseph.chamochumbi@vercel.com>",
