I'm not totally sure\nhow it was working before, some other workflow must have logged logged\nin at some point. This is just a debug step anyway, so I think we can\ndelete it. **I confirmed that the next step worked just fine.** We could\nalso add a step that runs `gh login` if we think it would actually be\nuseful.",
