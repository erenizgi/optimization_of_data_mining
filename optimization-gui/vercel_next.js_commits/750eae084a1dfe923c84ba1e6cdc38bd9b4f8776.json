Clarifying that the list of supported loaders is not exhaustive\n2. Adding a more detailed example showing how to pass options to loaders\nusing the object format\n3. Adding graphql-tag/loader to the list of supported loaders based on\ncustomer feedback\n\nThis addresses customer confusion about how to pass options to loaders\nand clarifies that many loaders beyond those explicitly listed will\nwork.\n\nLink to Devin run:\nhttps://app.devin.ai/sessions/33095930f1f34a6daf81c2ce7eca3be0\nRequested by: lee@vercel.com\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Devin AI <158243242+devin-ai-integration[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: lee@vercel.com <lee@vercel.com>\nCo-authored-by: Tim Neutkens <tim@timneutkens.nl>",
