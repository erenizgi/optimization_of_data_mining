    "message": "Webpack: handle file:// urls when finding sourcemaps (#76443)\n\nPreviously we only handled the eval sourcemaps case where the module id\nwas encoded into the source url. This handles cases when the `file://`\nprotocol is used, such as with Rspack.\n    \nTest Plan: `pnpm test-dev-rspack\ntest/development/acceptance-app/rsc-runtime-errors.test.ts`",
