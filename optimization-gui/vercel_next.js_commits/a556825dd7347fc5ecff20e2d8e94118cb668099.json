This reduces the need for manual memoization using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.\n \n-To use it, upgrade to Next.js 15, install the `babel-plugin-react-compiler`:\n+Next.js includes a custom performance optimization written in SWC that makes the React Compiler more efficient. Instead of running the compiler on every file, Next.js analyzes your project and only applies the React Compiler to relevant files. This avoids unnecessary work and leads to faster builds compared to using the Babel plugin on its own.\n+\n+## How It Works\n+\n+The React Compiler runs through a Babel plugin. To keep builds fast, Next.js uses a custom SWC optimization that only applies the React Compiler to relevant files—like those with JSX or React hooks.\n+\n+This avoids compiling everything and keeps the performance cost minimal. You may still see slightly slower builds compared to the default Rust-based compiler, but the impact is small and localized.\n+\n+To use it, install the `babel-plugin-react-compiler`:\n \n ```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n npm install babel-plugin-react-compiler\n@@ -37,8 +45,6 @@ const nextConfig = {\n module.exports = nextConfig\n ```\n \n-> **Note:** The React Compiler is currently only possible to use in Next.js through a Babel plugin. This will opt-out of Next.js's default [Rust-based compiler](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler), which could result in slower build times.
