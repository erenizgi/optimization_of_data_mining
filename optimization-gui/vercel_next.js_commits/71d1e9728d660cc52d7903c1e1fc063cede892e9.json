It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with `create-next-app`.\n+Next.js supports linting with either ESLint or Biome. Choose a linter and run it directly via `package.json` scripts.\n \n-To manually add ESLint to an existing project, add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:\n+- Use **ESLint** (comprehensive rules):\n \n ```json filename=\"package.json\"\n {\n   \"scripts\": {\n-    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n+    \"lint\": \"eslint\",\n+    \"lint:fix\": \"eslint --fix\"\n   }\n }\n ```\n \n-Then, run `npm run lint` and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.\n+- Or use **Biome** (fast linter + formatter):\n \n-```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n-npm run lint\n+```json filename=\"package.json\"\n+{\n+  \"scripts\": {\n+    \"lint\": \"biome check\",\n+    \"format\": \"biome format --write\"\n+  }\n+}\n ```\n \n-You'll see a prompt like this:\n+If your project previously used `next lint`, migrate your scripts to the ESLint CLI with the codemod:\n \n-> ? How would you like to configure ESLint?\n->\n-> ❯ Strict (recommended)\n-> Base\n-> Cancel\n-\n-- **Strict**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.\n-- **Base**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.\n-- **Cancel**: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.\n-\n-If `Strict` or `Base` are selected, Next.js will automatically install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` as dependencies in your application and create a configuration file in the root of your project.\n-\n-The ESLint config generated by `next lint` uses the older `.eslintrc.json` format. ESLint supports both [the legacy `.eslintrc.json` and the newer `eslint.config.mjs` format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuring-eslint).\n+```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n+npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .\n+```\n \n-You can manually replace `.eslintrc.json` with an `eslint.config.mjs` file using the setup recommended in our [ESLint API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#with-core-web-vitals), and installing the [`@eslint/eslintrc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint/eslintrc) package. This more closely matches the ESLint setup used by `create-next-app`.\n+If you use ESLint, create an explicit config (recommended `eslint.config.mjs`). ESLint supports both [the legacy `.eslintrc.*` and the newer `eslint.config.mjs` formats](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuring-eslint). See the [ESLint API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#with-core-web-vitals) for a recommended setup.\n \n-You can now run `next lint` every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (`next build`). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.\n+> **Good to know**: If an ESLint config is present, `next build` will still run linting in Next.js 15, but this automatic build-time linting will be removed in Next.js 16. Control when linting runs by invoking your linter via npm scripts.\n \n See the [ESLint Plugin](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/eslint) page for more information.\n "
