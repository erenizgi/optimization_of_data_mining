However, the comparison can be difficult since turbopack tends to produce fewer but larger chunks. Our advice is to focus on higher level metrics like [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) or your own application level metrics to compare performance across the two bundlers. We are however aware of one gap that can occasionally cause a large regression.\n-\n-Turbopack does not yet have an equivalent to the [Inner Graph Optimization](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationinnergraph) in webpack which is enabled by default. This optimization is useful to tree shake large modules. For example:\n-\n-```js filename=large.module.js\n-import heavy from 'some-heavy-dependency.js'\n-\n-export function usesHeavy() {\n-  return heavy.run()\n-}\n-\n-export const CONSTANT_VALUE = 3\n-```\n-\n-If an application only uses `CONSTANT_VALUE` Turbopack will detect this and delete the `usesHeavy` export but not the corresponding `import`. However, with the Inner Graph Optimization, webpack can delete the `import` too which can drop the dependency as well.\n-\n-We are planning to offer an equivalent to the Inner Graph Optimization in Turbopack but it is still under development. If you are affected by this gap, consider manually splitting modules.\n-\n ### Build Caching\n \n Webpack supports [disk build caching](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/#cache) to improve build performance. Turbopack provides a similar feature, currently in beta. Starting with Next 16, you can enable Turbopack’s filesystem cache by setting the following experimental flags:"
