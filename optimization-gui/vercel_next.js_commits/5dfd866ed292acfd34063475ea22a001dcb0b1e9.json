    "message": "Treat _debugInfo as a wellknown property for sync request data access purposes (#78942)\n\nWhen we converted our request access APIs to async we supported sync\naccess to make the adoption easier. We do have a list of certain builtin\nproperties that exist on promises or are tested for in the course of\nruntime operations that we say are not synchronously accessible however\nand you must await the request data promise to access those if\nnecessary.\n\nRecently it was discoverd that React will check the `_debugInfo`\nproperty of thenables and other async data types in dev. This was being\nreported as a warning when passing searchParams from RSC to client\nworld. By adding `_debugInfo` to the wellKnownProperties set we can\navoid this warning by also making it so you must await the promise to\naccess a true request value such as `?_debugInfo=...` in a search\nstring.\n\nThis change adds this property name to the well known set",
