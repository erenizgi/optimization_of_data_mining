Consider exploring features like background sync, periodic background sync, or the File System Access API to enhance your application. For inspiration and up-to-date information on PWA capabilities, you can refer to resources like [What PWA Can Do Today](https://whatpwacando.today/).\n-2. **Static Exports:** If your application requires not running a server, and instead using a static export of files, you can update the Next.js configuration to enable this change.

You can find an example of how to integrate Serwist with Next.js in their [documentation](https://github.com/serwist/serwist/tree/main/examples/next-basic). **Note:** this plugin currently requires webpack configuration.\n 4. **Security Considerations**: Ensure that your service worker is properly secured. This includes using HTTPS, validating the source of push messages, and implementing proper error handling.\n 5. **User Experience**: Consider implementing progressive enhancement techniques to ensure your app works well even when certain PWA features are not supported by the user's browser."
