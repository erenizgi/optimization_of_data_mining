You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n \n-[Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust, and built into Next.js. Turbopack can be used in Next.js in both the `pages` and `app` directories for faster local development.\n+Turbopack is an **incremental bundler** optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust, and built into **Next.js**. You can use Turbopack with both the Pages and App Router for a **much faster** local development experience.\n \n-To enable Turbopack, use the `--turbopack` flag when running the Next.js development server.\n+## Why Turbopack?\n+\n+We built Turbopack to push the performance of Next.js, including:\n+\n+- **Unified Graph:** Next.js supports multiple output environments (e.g., client and server). Managing multiple compilers and stitching bundles together can be tedious. Turbopack uses a **single, unified graph** for all environments.\n+- **Bundling vs Native ESM:** Some tools skip bundling in development and rely on the browser's native ESM. This works well for small apps but can slow down large apps due to excessive network requests. Turbopack **bundles** in dev, but in an optimized way to keep large apps fast.\n+- **Incremental Computation:** Turbopack parallelizes work across cores and **caches** results down to the function level. Once a piece of work is done, Turbopack won’t repeat it.\n+- **Lazy Bundling:** Turbopack only bundles what is actually requested by the dev server. This lazy approach can reduce initial compile times and memory usage.\n+\n+## Getting started\n+\n+To enable Turbopack in your Next.js project, use the `--turbopack` flag when running the development server:\n \n ```json filename=\"package.json\" highlight={3}\n {\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"dev\": \"next dev --turbopack\",\n     \"build\": \"next build\",\n-    \"start\": \"next start\",\n-    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n+    \"start\": \"next start\"\n   }\n }\n ```\n \n-## Reference\n+Currently, Turbopack only supports `next dev`. Build (`next build`) is **not yet** supported. We are actively working on production support as Turbopack moves closer to stability.\n+\n+## Supported features\n+\n+Turbopack in Next.js has **zero-configuration** for the common use cases. Below is a summary of what is supported out of the box, plus some references to how you can configure Turbopack further when needed.\n+\n+### Language features\n+\n+| Feature                     | Status                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n+| --------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n+| **JavaScript & TypeScript** | **Supported**         | Uses SWC under the hood. Type-checking is not done by Turbopack (run `tsc --watch` or rely on your IDE for type checks).                                                                            |\n+| **ECMAScript (ESNext)**     | **Supported**         | Turbopack supports the latest ECMAScript features, matching SWC’s coverage.                                                                                                                         |\n+| **CommonJS**                | **Supported**         | `require()` syntax is handled out of the box.                                                                                                                                                       |\n+| **ESM**                     | **Supported**         | Static and dynamic `import` are fully supported.                                                                                                                                                    |\n+| **Babel**                   | Partially Unsupported | Turbopack does not include Babel by default. However, you can [configure `babel-loader` via the Turbopack config](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo#configuring-webpack-loaders). |\n \n-### Supported features\n+### Framework and React features\n \n-Turbopack in Next.js requires zero-configuration for most users and can be extended for more advanced use cases.

Support for production builds is in active development.\n+- **Legacy CSS Modules features**\n+  - Standalone `:local` and `:global` pseudo-classes (only the function variant `:global(...)` is supported).\n+  - The `@value` rule (superseded by CSS variables).\n   - `:import` and `:export` ICSS rules.\n-- [Invalid CSS comment syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51843506/are-double-slash-comments-valid-in-css) such as `//`\n-  - CSS comments should be written as `/* comment */` per the specification.\n-  - Preprocessors such as Sass do support this alternative syntax for comments.\n-- [`webpack()`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/webpack) configuration in `next.config.js`\n-  - Turbopack replaces Webpack, this means that webpack configuration is not supported.\n-  - To configure Turbopack, [see the documentation](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo).\n-  - A subset of [Webpack loaders](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo#configuring-webpack-loaders) are supported in Turbopack.\n-- Babel (`.babelrc`)\n-  - Turbopack leverages the [SWC](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#why-swc) compiler for all transpilation and optimizations. This means that Babel is not included by default.\n-  - If you have a `.babelrc` file, you might no longer need it because Next.js includes common Babel plugins as SWC transforms that can be enabled. You can read more about this in the [compiler documentation](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#supported-features).\n-  - If you still need to use Babel after verifying your particular use case is not covered, you can leverage Turbopack's [support for custom webpack loaders](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo#configuring-webpack-loaders) to include `babel-loader`.\n-- Creating a root layout automatically in App Router.\n-  - This behavior is currently not supported since it changes input files, instead, an error will be shown for you to manually add a root layout in the desired location.\n-- `@next/font` (legacy font support).\n-  - `@next/font` is deprecated in favor of `next/font`. [`next/font`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) is fully supported with Turbopack.\n-- [Relay transforms](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#relay)\n-  - We are planning to implement this in the future.\n-- Blocking `.css` imports in `pages/_document.tsx`\n-  - Currently with webpack Next.js blocks importing `.css` files in `pages/_document.tsx`\n-  - We are planning to implement this warning in the future.\n-- [`experimental.typedRoutes`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/typedRoutes)\n-  - We are planning to implement this in the future.\n-- `experimental.nextScriptWorkers`\n-  - We are planning to implement this in the future.\n-- `experimental.sri.algorithm`\n-  - We are planning to implement this in the future.\n-- `experimental.fallbackNodePolyfills`\n-  - We are planning to implement this in the future.\n-- `experimental.esmExternals`\n-  - We are currently not planning to support the legacy esmExternals configuration in Next.js with Turbopack.\n-- [AMP](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/amp).\n-  - We are currently not planning to support AMP in Next.js with Turbopack.\n-- Yarn PnP\n-  - We are currently not planning to support Yarn PnP in Next.js with Turbopack.\n-- [`experimental.urlImports`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/urlImports)\n-  - We are currently not planning to support `experimental.urlImports` in Next.js with Turbopack.\n-- [`:import` and `:export` ICSS rules](https://github.com/css-modules/icss)\n-  - We are currently not planning to support `:import` and `:export` ICSS rules in Next.js with Turbopack as [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/css-modules.html) the CSS parser Turbopack uses does not support these rules.\n-- `unstable_allowDynamic` configuration in edge runtime\n-\n-## Examples\n-\n-### Generating Trace Files\n-\n-Trace files allow the Next.js team to investigate and improve performance metrics and memory usage. To generate a trace file, append `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1` to the `next dev --turbopack` command, this will generate a `.next/trace-turbopack` file.\n-\n-When reporting issues related to Turbopack performance and memory usage, please include the trace file in your [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) issue.\n+- **`webpack()` configuration** in `next.config.js`\n+  Turbopack replaces webpack, so `webpack()` configs are not recognized. Use the [`experimental.turbo` config](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo) instead.\n+- **AMP**\n+  Not planned for Turbopack support in Next.js.\n+- **Yarn PnP**\n+  Not planned for Turbopack support in Next.js.\n+- **`experimental.urlImports`**\n+  Not planned for Turbopack.\n+- **`experimental.esmExternals`**\n+  Not planned. Turbopack does not support the legacy `esmExternals` configuration in Next.js.\n+- **Some Next.js Experimental Flags**\n+  - `experimental.typedRoutes`\n+  - `experimental.nextScriptWorkers`\n+  - `experimental.sri.algorithm`\n+  - `experimental.fallbackNodePolyfills`\n+    We plan to implement these in the future.\n+\n+For a full, detailed breakdown of each feature flag and its status, see the [Turbopack API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo).\n+\n+## Configuration\n+\n+Turbopack can be configured via `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`) under the `experimental.turbo` key. Configuration options include:\n+\n+- **`rules`**\n+  Define additional [webpack loaders](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo#configuring-webpack-loaders) for file transformations.\n+- **`resolveAlias`**\n+  Create manual aliases (like `resolve.alias` in webpack).\n+- **`resolveExtensions`**\n+  Change or extend file extensions for module resolution.\n+- **`moduleIdStrategy`**\n+  Set how module IDs are generated (`'named'` vs `'deterministic'`).\n+- **`treeShaking`**\n+  Enable or disable tree shaking in dev and future production builds.\n+- **`memoryLimit`**\n+  Set a memory limit (in bytes) for Turbopack.\n+\n+```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n+module.exports = {\n+  experimental: {\n+    turbo: {\n+      // Example: adding an alias and custom file extension\n+      resolveAlias: {\n+        underscore: 'lodash',\n+      },\n+      resolveExtensions: ['.mdx', '.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '.json'],\n+    },\n+  },\n+}\n+```\n+\n+For more in-depth configuration examples, see the [Turbopack config documentation](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo).\n+\n+## Generating trace files for performance debugging\n+\n+If you encounter performance or memory issues and want to help the Next.js team diagnose them, you can generate a trace file by appending `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1` to your dev command:\n+\n+```bash\n+NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 next dev --turbopack\n+```\n+\n+This will produce a `.next/trace-turbopack` file. Include that file when creating a GitHub issue on the [Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) to help us investigate.\n+\n+## Summary\n+\n+Turbopack is a **Rust-based**, **incremental** bundler designed to make local development and builds fast—especially for large applications. It is integrated into Next.js, offering zero-config CSS, React, and TypeScript support.\n+\n+Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve Turbopack and add production build support. In the meantime, give it a try with `next dev --turbopack` and let us know your feedback."
