    "message": "docs: add note clarifying project root in monorepo (#84628)\n\n### What?\n- Adding a small note to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"project\nroot\" in the documentation for next.config output, specifically in\nregards to a monorepo setup\n\n### Why?\n- While doing some debugging related to a container that I cannot build\nlocally for compliance reasons, I had to take shots in the dark to\nfigure this behavior out 😄 hoping it can help the next soul who finds\nthemselves in a similar predicament\n\n### How?\n- Explain that in monorepos, \"project root\" does not mean the root of\nthe monorepo, but instead the root of the nextjs app\n\n\n\nFirst time contributing, so I appreciate any reviews/feedback I can get\nhere, even for such a small PR. Thanks!\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Joseph <joseph.chamochumbi@vercel.com>\nCo-authored-by: Joseph <sephxd1234@gmail.com>",
