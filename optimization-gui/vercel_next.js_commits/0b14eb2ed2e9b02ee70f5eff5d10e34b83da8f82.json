See:\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\n\n### Adding a feature\n\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature\nrequest has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A\ndiscussion must be opened, see\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\n- e2e tests added\n(https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\n- Documentation added\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\n\n\n## For Maintainers\n\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to\nunderstand the PR)\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the\nconclusion\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic\nbehind a change\n\n### What?\n\n### Why?\n\n### How?\n\nCloses NEXT-\nFixes #\n\n-->\n\n### What?\n\nMake a note about the `$ACTION_` properties in `formData`\n\n### Why?\n\nStarting with next@14.1.3, `$ACTION_` properties have appeared in the\n`formData`, which cause validation errors when used with a strict\nvalidation with a library such as Zod or Yup:\n\n```tsx\n// Form Client Component\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(action, {\n    type: 'initial',\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <form action={action}>\n      {/* ... */}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n// Server Action\nexport async function action(\n  prevState: ServerActionReturnValue,\n  formData: FormData,\n): Promise<ServerActionReturnValue> {\n  const validationResult = await schema.validate(\n    Object.fromEntries(formData.entries()),\n  );\n```\n\nThe errors from Yup:\n\nErrors:\n\n- this field has unspecified keys: $ACTION_REF_1, $ACTION_1:0,\n$ACTION_1:1, $ACTION_KEY\nThe data in the formData.entries()\n\n```js\n{\n  '$ACTION_REF_1': '',\n  '$ACTION_1:0': '{\"id\":\"59f475b...\",\"bound\":\"$@1\"}',\n  '$ACTION_1:1': '[{\"type\":\"initial\"}]',\n  '$ACTION_KEY': 'k187677481',\n  // Real form data starts here:\n  year: '2024',\n```\n\n### How?\n\n1. Document additional properties with keys starting with the prefix\n`$ACTION_`\n2. Remove the obsolete mention of `.entries()`, since that is not being\nused in the code example anymore (previously, it was `const rawFormData\n= Object.fromEntries(formData.entries())`)\n\n### History\n\n- The `$ACTION_` property change was added in\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/63048\n- The `docs/01-app/02-guides/forms.mdx` file was added in PR\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/79288 , without the `$ACTION_`\nproperty change\n\ncc @delbaoliveira\n\nCo-authored-by: Joseph <joseph.chamochumbi@vercel.com>",
