    "message": "fix: Rspack dev gets stuck after removing a page (#80555)\n\nRspack's incremental build algorithm causes a situation where deleted\nentries in dynamic entries still get built.\n\nIf a page is deleted, an infinite loop occurs in the corresponding\n`next-app-loader`, causing the entire compilation to hang.\n\nThe root cause of the hang lies in `const resolvedPagePath = await\nresolver(matchedPagePath)` failing to resolve `resolvedPagePath`,\npreventing the loop from exiting.\n\nWhen `resolvedPagePath` doesn't exist, we should immediately throw an\nError. This logic would also benefit webpack, as scenarios where pages\nare deleted during the execution of `next-app-loader` do occur.",
