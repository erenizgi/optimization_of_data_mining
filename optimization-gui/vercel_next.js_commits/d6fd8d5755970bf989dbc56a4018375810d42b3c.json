    "message": "fix: make sure that the patched fetch cache set promise is properly awaited (#75971)\n\nThe [promise created for updating the incremental cache on successful\nfetches](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/106e17ca8f093899d300885938eab863ffa478a7/packages/next/src/server/lib/patch-fetch.ts#L687-L728)\nis not used, returned nor awaited in any way. I imagine that this can be\nfine in environments such as Node.js servers where the dangling promise\nwill eventually run, in other environments however the promise might be\ncancelled causing the cache update not to happen, so it would be\nappropriate, when possible that the promise is awaited using `waitUntil`\n(for more context, I've encountered this issue in the [OpenNext\nproject](https://github.com/opennextjs)).\n\nSo in this PR I'm adding the promise to the `pendingRevalidates` map so\nthat it will eventually be properly awaited.\n\ncc. @vicb, @conico974\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!
