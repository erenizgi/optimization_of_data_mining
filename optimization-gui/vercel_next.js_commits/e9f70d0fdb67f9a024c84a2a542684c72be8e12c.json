    "message": "docs: fix grammar in Code of Conduct section ('them' → 'it')  (#80181)\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that\nyou follow the checklist sections below.\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\n-->\n\n## What?\n\nFixed a grammatical issue in the Code of Conduct section of\n`packages/next/README.md`.\nChanged “adhere to them” to “adhere to it”.\n\n## Why?\n\n\"Code of Conduct\" is a singular noun, so using \"them\" is grammatically\nincorrect. The correct pronoun is \"it\".\n\n## How?\n\nEdited the relevant sentence in `packages/next/README.md`.\n\n<!--\nCloses NEXT-\nFixes #\n-->\n\nCo-authored-by: JJ Kasper <jj@jjsweb.site>",
