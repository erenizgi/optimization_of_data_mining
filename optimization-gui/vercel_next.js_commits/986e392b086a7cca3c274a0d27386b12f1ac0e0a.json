    "message": "Document Turbopack trace viewer (#78184)\n\nExplains how to run the Turbopack trace viewer. This tool is focused on\nlow-level observability. We use it to optimize Turbopack performance and\nmemory usage. It's also useful for finding slowdowns caused by\ncustomization like postcss / custom loaders and such.\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!
