    "message": "[release-old] use `backport` NPM dist tag instead of `stable` for backports (#79612)\n\nPR https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/79596 introduced setting\n`stable` dist tag for backports, but due to\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/79538#pullrequestreview-2866854431,\n\n> This sounds like something users would use. However, it might point to\n14.x when 15.x exists and we would certainly want people to use 14.x.\nIt's also weird that 14.x would have a `stable` tag but not 15.x.\n> \n> That's why `backport` makes more sense since it's less specific and\nnot common vernacular when talking about release characteristics (e.g.\n\"experimental\", \"nightly\", \"stable\", \"unstable\" etc.).\n> \n> The tag could actually just be \"internal-backport\" and ideally we'd\nremove it right after publish. The goal here isn't to come up with a\nuseful tag for backports. We just want to work around NPM requiring a\ntag during publish.\n\nbetter to use another dist tag: i.e.,`backport`.",
