    "message": "docs: remove removed examples guidelines reference from PR template (#83043)\n\n## For Maintainers\n\n### What?\n\nRemoved the references to the now-deleted examples guidelines from the\nPR template. Specifically, removed the line about\n\n```\nThe \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\n``` \nsince that file and folder were deleted in PR\n[#77050](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/77050).\n\n### Why?\n\nThe `/examples` folder and its `adding-examples.md` file were removed,\nso the reference in the PR template to those guidelines is outdated and\nmisleading. Keeping those references causes confusion for contributors\nby pointing to non-existent documentation.\n\n### How?\n\n- Edited the PR template file.\n- Removed the outdated examples guidelines reference line.\n- Left other template content unchanged to preserve existing guidance.\n\nThis ensures the PR template stays accurate, up-to-date, and helpful for\ncontributors.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Joseph <joseph.chamochumbi@vercel.com>",
