These keys are periodically recalculated between builds for enhanced security.\n+\n+When self-hosting your Next.js application across multiple servers, each server instance may end up with a different encryption key, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n+\n+## Possible Ways to Fix It\n+\n+To mitigate this, you can overwrite the encryption key using the `process.env.NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. Specifying this variable ensures that your encryption keys are persistent across builds, and all server instances use the same key. This variable **must** be AES-GCM encrypted.\n+\n+In a non-self-hosted environment, you can use a feature such as [Skew Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection) to ensure assets and functions from the previous version are still available, even after a new version is deployed.\n+\n+## Useful Links\n+\n+- [Server Actions - Security](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#security)\n+- [Overwriting encryption keys (advanced)](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#overwriting-encryption-keys-advanced)"
