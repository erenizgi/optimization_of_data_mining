This clarification helps developers understand\nthe limitation and how to handle such cases.\n\n**References**  \n- [Vercel Changelog:\nCVE-2025-57752](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-57752)\n- [Next.js GitHub Issue\n#82703](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/82703)\n\n---\n\nresolves #82610\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Joseph <sephxd1234@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Steven <steven@ceriously.com>",
