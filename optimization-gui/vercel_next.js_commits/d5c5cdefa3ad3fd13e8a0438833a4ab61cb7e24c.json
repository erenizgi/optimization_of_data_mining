    "message": "Update the warning text for when multiple lockfiles are found (#80214)\n\n## Improve multiple lockfiles warning message\n\n### What?\nEnhances the warning message when multiple lockfiles are detected to\nexplicitly show which lockfile was ultimately selected. Based on\nfeedback from @lukesandberg in a previous PR.\n\n### Why?\nThe previous warning message only listed the lockfiles that should be\nremoved but didn't indicate which one was actually being used. This\nimprovement makes it clearer to users which lockfile Next.js is\nselecting when multiple are present.\n\n### How?\nUpdated the warning message to include \"Selecting [selected lockfile]\"\nbefore suggesting which lockfiles to remove.",
