You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n-\n-Next.js comes with a variety of built-in optimizations designed to improve your application's speed and [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). This guide will cover the optimizations you can leverage to enhance your user experience.\n-\n-## Built-in Components\n-\n-Built-in components abstract away the complexity of implementing common UI optimizations. These components are:\n-\n-- **Images**: Built on the native `<img>` element. The Image Component optimizes images for performance by lazy loading and automatically resizing images based on device size.\n-- **Link**: Built on the native `<a>` tags. The Link Component prefetches pages in the background, for faster and smoother page transitions.\n-- **Scripts**: Built on the native `<script>` tags. The Script Component gives you control over loading and execution of third-party scripts.\n-\n-## Metadata\n-\n-Metadata helps search engines understand your content better (which can result in better SEO), and allows you to customize how your content is presented on social media, helping you create a more engaging and consistent user experience across various platforms.\n-\n-<AppOnly>\n-\n-The Metadata API in Next.js allows you to modify the `<head>` element of a page. You can configure metadata in two ways:\n-\n-- **Config-based Metadata**: Export a [static `metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object) or a dynamic [`generateMetadata` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#generatemetadata-function) in a `layout.js` or `page.js` file.\n-- **File-based Metadata**: Add static or dynamically generated special files to route segments.\n-\n-Additionally, you can create dynamic Open Graph Images using JSX and CSS with [imageResponse](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response) constructor.\n-\n-</AppOnly>\n-\n-<PagesOnly>\n-\n-The Head Component in Next.js allows you to modify the `<head>` of a page. Learn more in the [Head Component](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head) documentation.\n-\n-</PagesOnly>\n-\n-## Static Assets\n-\n-Next.js `/public` folder can be used to serve static assets like images, fonts, and other files. Files inside `/public` can also be cached by CDN providers so that they are delivered efficiently.\n-\n-## Analytics and Monitoring\n-\n-For large applications, Next.js integrates with popular analytics and monitoring tools to help you understand how your application is performing. Learn more in the <PagesOnly>[Analytics](/docs/app/guides/analytics), </PagesOnly> [OpenTelemetry](/docs/pages/guides/open-telemetry)<PagesOnly>,</PagesOnly> and [Instrumentation](/docs/pages/guides/instrumentation) guides."
