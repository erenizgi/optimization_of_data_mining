However, you can mark a folder as a **Route Group** to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.\n-\n-This allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.\n-\n-Route groups are useful for:\n-\n-- Organizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.\n-- Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:\n-  - Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts\n-  - Opting specific segments into a layout\n-- Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route\n-\n-## Convention\n-\n-A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: `(folderName)`\n-\n-> **Good to know**:\n->\n-> - The naming of route groups has no special significance other than for organization. They do not affect the URL path.\n-> - Routes that include a route group **should not** resolve to the same URL path as other routes. For example, since route groups don't affect URL structure, `(marketing)/about/page.js` and `(shop)/about/page.js` would both resolve to `/about` and cause an error.\n-> - If you use multiple root layouts without a top-level `layout.js` file, your home `page.js` file should be defined in one of the route groups, For example: `app/(marketing)/page.js`.\n-> - Navigating **across multiple root layouts** will cause a **full page load** (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from `/cart` that uses `app/(shop)/layout.js` to `/blog` that uses `app/(marketing)/layout.js` will cause a full page load. This **only** applies to multiple root layouts."
