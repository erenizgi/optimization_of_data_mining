When you need interactivity or browser APIs, you can use [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) to layer in functionality.\n+\n+This page explains how Server and Client Components work in Next.js, when to use them, and how to compose them together in your application.\n+\n+## How do Server and Client Components work in Next.js?\n+\n+### On the server\n+\n+On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks, by individual route segments ([layouts and pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages)):\n+\n+- **Server Components** are rendered into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).\n+- **Client Components** and the RSC Payload are used to [prerender](/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering#how-does-partial-prerendering-work) HTML.\n+\n+> **What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?**\n+>\n+> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:\n+>\n+> - The rendered result of Server Components\n+> - Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files\n+> - Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component\n+\n+### On the client (first load)\n+\n+Then, on the client:\n+\n+1. **HTML** is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route to the user.\n+2. **RSC Payload** is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees.\n+3. **JavaScript** is used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.\n+\n+> **What is hydration?**\n+>\n+> Hydration is React's process for attaching [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events) to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive.\n+\n+### Subsequent Navigations\n+\n+On subsequent navigations:\n+\n+- The **RSC Payload** is prefetched and cached for instant navigation.\n+- **Client Components** are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.\n+\n+## When to use Server and Client Components?\n+\n+The client and server environments have different capabilities. Server and Client components allow you to run logic in each environment, and compose them together in the same application.\n+\n+Use **Client Components** when you need:\n+\n+- [State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state) and [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events). E.g. `onClick`, `onChange`.\n+- [Lifecycle logic](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects). E.g. `useEffect`.\n+- Browser-only APIs. E.g. `localStorage`, `window`, `Navigator.geolocation`, etc.\n+- [Custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).\n+\n+Use **Server Components** when you need:\n+\n+- Fetch data from databases or APIs close to the source.\n+- Use API keys, tokens, and other secrets without exposing them to the client.\n+- Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.\n+- Improve the [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/), and stream content progressively to the client.\n+\n+For example, the `<Page>` component is a Server Component that fetches data about a post, and passes it as props to the `<LikeButton>` which handles client-side interactivity.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/[id]/page.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'\n+import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'\n+\n+export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n+  const post = await getPost(params.id)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <main>\n+        <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n+        {/* ... */}\n+        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />\n+      </main>\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/[id]/page.js\" highlight={1} switcher\n+import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'\n+import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'\n+\n+export default async function Page({ params }) {\n+  const post = await getPost(params.id)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <main>\n+        <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n+        {/* ... */}\n+        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />\n+      </main>\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/ui/like-button.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+\n+export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {\n+  // ...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/ui/like-button.js\" highlight={1} switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+\n+export default function LikeButton({ likes }) {\n+  // ...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Examples\n+\n+### Using Client Components\n+\n+You can create a Client Component by adding the [`\"use client\"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) directive at the top of the file, above your imports.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/ui/counter.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+\n+export default function Counter() {\n+  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <p>{count} likes</p>\n+      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/ui/counter.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+\n+export default function Counter() {\n+  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <p>{count} likes</p>\n+      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+`\"use client\"` is used to declare a **boundary** between the Server and Client module graphs (trees).\n+\n+Once a file is marked with `\"use client\"`, **all its imports and child components are considered part of the client bundle**. This means you don't need to add the directive to every component that is intended for the client.\n+\n+### Reducing JS bundle size\n+\n+To reduce the size of your client JavaScript bundles, add `'use client'` to specific interactive components instead of marking large parts of your UI as Client Components.\n+\n+For example, the `<Layout>` component contains mostly static elements like a logo and navigation links, but includes an interactive search bar. `<Search />` is interactive and needs to be a Client Component, however, the rest of the layout can remain a Server Component.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/ui/search.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+export default function Search() {\n+  // ...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/ui/search.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+export default function Search() {\n+  // ...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n+// Client Component\n+import Search from './search'\n+// Server Component\n+import Logo from './logo'\n+\n+// Layout is a Server Component by default\n+export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n+  return (\n+    <>\n+      <nav>\n+        <Logo />\n+        <Search />\n+      </nav>\n+      <main>{children}</main>\n+    </>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n+// Client Component\n+import Search from './search'\n+// Server Component\n+import Logo from './logo'\n+\n+// Layout is a Server Component by default\n+export default function Layout({ children }) {\n+  return (\n+    <>\n+      <nav>\n+        <Logo />\n+        <Search />\n+      </nav>\n+      <main>{children}</main>\n+    </>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Passing data from Server to Client Components\n+\n+You can pass data from Server Components to Client Components using props.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/[id]/page.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'\n+import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'\n+\n+export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n+  const post = await getPost(params.id)\n+\n+  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/ui/like-button.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {\n+  // ...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Alternatively, you can stream data from a Server Component to a Client Component with the [`use` Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use). See an [example](/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data#streaming-data-with-the-use-hook).\n+\n+> **Good to know**: Props passed to Client Components need to be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values) by React.\n+\n+### Interleaving Server and Client Components\n+\n+You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component. This allows you to visually nest server-rendered UI within Client components.\n+\n+A common pattern is to use `children` to create a _slot_ in a `<ClientComponent>`. For example, a `<Cart>` component that fetches data on the server, inside a `<Modal>` component that uses client state to toggle visibility.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/ui/modal.tsx\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+export default function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n+  return <div>{children}</div>\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/ui/modal.js\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+export default function Modal({ children }) {\n+  return <div>{children}</div>\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Then, in a parent Server Component (e.g.`<Page>`), you can pass a `<Cart>` as the child of the `<Modal>`:\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\"  highlight={7} switcher\n+import Modal from './ui/modal'\n+import Cart from './ui/cart'\n+\n+export default function Page() {\n+  return (\n+    <Modal>\n+      <Cart />\n+    </Modal>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" highlight={7} switcher\n+import Modal from './ui/modal'\n+import Cart from './ui/cart'\n+\n+export default function Page() {\n+  return (\n+    <Modal>\n+      <Cart />\n+    </Modal>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this pattern, all Server Components will be rendered on the server ahead of time, including those as props. The resulting RSC payload will contain references of where Client Components should be rendered within the component tree.\n+\n+### Context providers\n+\n+[React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is commonly used to share global state like the current theme. However, React context is not supported in Server Components.\n+\n+To use context, create a Client Component that accepts `children`:\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/theme-provider.tsx\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { createContext } from 'react'\n+\n+export const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n+\n+export default function ThemeProvider({\n+  children,\n+}: {\n+  children: React.ReactNode\n+}) {\n+  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/theme-provider.js\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { createContext } from 'react'\n+\n+export const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n+\n+export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {\n+  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Then, import it into a Server Component (e.g. `layout`):\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n+import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n+\n+export default function RootLayout({\n+  children,\n+}: {\n+  children: React.ReactNode\n+}) {\n+  return (\n+    <html>\n+      <body>\n+        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n+      </body>\n+    </html>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n+import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n+\n+export default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n+  return (\n+    <html>\n+      <body>\n+        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n+      </body>\n+    </html>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Your Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider, and all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.\n+\n+> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.\n+\n+### Third-party components\n+\n+When using a third-party component that relies on client-only features, you can wrap it in a Client Component to ensure it works as expected.\n+\n+For example, the `<Carousel />` can be imported from the `acme-carousel` package. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `\"use client\"` directive.\n+\n+If you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/gallery.tsx\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n+\n+export default function Gallery() {\n+  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n+      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n+      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/gallery.js\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n+\n+export default function Gallery() {\n+  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n+      {/*  Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n+      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+However, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error. This is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.\n+\n+To fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/carousel.tsx\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n+\n+export default Carousel\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/carousel.js\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n+\n+export default Carousel\n+```\n+\n+Now, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n+import Carousel from './carousel'\n+\n+export default function Page() {\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <p>View pictures</p>\n+      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n+      <Carousel />\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n+import Carousel from './carousel'\n+\n+export default function Page() {\n+  return (\n+    <div>\n+      <p>View pictures</p>\n+      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n+      <Carousel />\n+    </div>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+> **Advice for Library Authors**\n+>\n+> If you’re building a component library, add the `\"use client\"` directive to entry points that rely on client-only features. This lets your users import components into Server Components without needing to create wrappers.\n+>\n+> It's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `\"use client\"` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `\"use client\"` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.\n+\n+### Preventing environment poisoning\n+\n+JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules. This means it's possible to accidentanlly import server-only code into the client.\n+\n+For example, take the following function:\n+\n+```ts filename=\"lib/data.ts\" switcher\n+export async function getData() {\n+  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n+    headers: {\n+      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n+    },\n+  })\n+\n+  return res.json()\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```js filename=\"lib/data.js\" switcher\n+export async function getData() {\n+  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n+    headers: {\n+      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n+    },\n+  })\n+\n+  return res.json()\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This function contains an `API_KEY` that should never be exposed to the client.\n+\n+In Next.js, only environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are included in the client bundle. If variables are not prefixed, Next.js replaces them with an empty string.\n+\n+As a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected.\n+\n+To prevent accidental usage in Client Components, you can use the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only).\n+\n+```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n+npm install server-only\n+```\n+\n+Then, import the package into a file that contains server-only code:\n+\n+```js filename=\"lib/data.js\"\n+import 'server-only'\n+\n+export async function getData() {\n+  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n+    headers: {\n+      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n+    },\n+  })\n+\n+  return res.json()\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Now, if you try to import the module into a Client Component, there will be a build-time error.\n+\n+> **Good to know**: The corresponding [`client-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-only) can be used to mark modules that contain client-only code – for example, code that accesses the `window` object."

In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering, and there are three different server rendering strategies:\n-\n-- [Static Rendering](#static-rendering-default)\n-- [Dynamic Rendering](#dynamic-rendering)\n-- [Streaming](#streaming)\n-\n-This page will go through how Server Components work, when you might use them, and the different server rendering strategies.\n-\n-## Benefits of Server Rendering\n-\n-There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the server, including:\n-\n-- **Data Fetching**: Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source. This can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the number of requests the client needs to make.\n-- **Security**: Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.\n-- **Caching**: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users. This can improve performance and reduce cost by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.\n-- **Performance**: Server Components give you additional tools to optimize performance from the baseline. For example, if you start with an app composed of entirely Client Components, moving non-interactive pieces of your UI to Server Components can reduce the amount of client-side JavaScript needed. This is beneficial for users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the browser has less client-side JavaScript to download, parse, and execute.\n-- **Initial Page Load and [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/)**: On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page.\n-- **Search Engine Optimization and Social Network Shareability**: The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.\n-- **Streaming**: Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.\n-\n-## Using Server Components in Next.js\n-\n-By default, Next.js uses Server Components. This allows you to automatically implement server rendering with no additional configuration, and you can opt into using Client Components when needed, see [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n-\n-## How are Server Components rendered?\n-\n-On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks: by individual route segments and [Suspense Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n-\n-Each chunk is rendered in two steps:\n-\n-1. React renders Server Components into a special data format called the **React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload)**.\n-2. Next.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render **HTML** on the server.\n-\n-{/* Rendering Diagram */}\n-\n-Then, on the client:\n-\n-1. The HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route - this is for the initial page load only.\n-2. The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\n-3. The JavaScript instructions are used to [hydrate](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Client Components and make the application interactive.\n-\n-> #### What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?\n->\n-> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:\n->\n-> - The rendered result of Server Components\n-> - Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files\n-> - Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component\n-\n-## Server Rendering Strategies\n-\n-There are three subsets of server rendering: Static, Dynamic, and Streaming.\n-\n-### Static Rendering (Default)\n-\n-With Static Rendering, routes are rendered at **build time**, or in the background after [data revalidation](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration). The result is cached and can be pushed to a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/CDN). This optimization allows you to share the result of the rendering work between users and server requests.\n-\n-Static rendering is useful when a route has data that is not personalized to the user and can be known at build time, such as a static blog post or a product page.\n-\n-### Dynamic Rendering\n-\n-With Dynamic Rendering, routes are rendered for each user at **request time**.\n-\n-Dynamic rendering is useful when a route has data that is personalized to the user or has information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL's search params.\n-\n-> **Dynamic Routes with Cached Data**\n->\n-> In most websites, routes are not fully static or fully dynamic - it's a spectrum. For example, you can have an e-commerce page that uses cached product data that's revalidated at an interval, but also has uncached, personalized customer data.\n->\n-> In Next.js, you can have dynamically rendered routes that have both cached and uncached data. This is because the RSC Payload and data are cached separately. This allows you to opt into dynamic rendering without worrying about the performance impact of fetching all the data at request time.\n->\n-> Learn more about the [full-route cache](/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#full-route-cache) and [Data Cache](/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#data-cache).\n-\n-#### Switching to Dynamic Rendering\n-\n-During rendering, if a [Dynamic API](#dynamic-apis) or a [fetch](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) option of `{ cache: 'no-store' }` is discovered, Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route. This table summarizes how Dynamic APIs and data caching affect whether a route is statically or dynamically rendered:\n-\n-| Dynamic APIs | Data       | Route                |\n-| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |\n-| No           | Cached     | Statically Rendered  |\n-| Yes          | Cached     | Dynamically Rendered |\n-| No           | Not Cached | Dynamically Rendered |\n-| Yes          | Not Cached | Dynamically Rendered |\n-\n-In the table above, for a route to be fully static, all data must be cached. However, you can have a dynamically rendered route that uses both cached and uncached data fetches.\n-\n-As a developer, you do not need to choose between static and dynamic rendering as Next.js will automatically choose the best rendering strategy for each route based on the features and APIs used. Instead, you choose when to [cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching) or [revalidate specific data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration), and you may choose to [stream](#streaming) parts of your UI.\n-\n-### Dynamic APIs\n-\n-Dynamic APIs rely on information that can only be known at request time (and not ahead of time during prerendering). Using any of these APIs signals the developer's intention and will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at the request time. These APIs include:\n-\n-- [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)\n-- [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers)\n-- [`connection`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection)\n-- [`draftMode`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/draft-mode)\n-- [`searchParams` prop](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional)\n-- [`unstable_noStore`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_noStore)\n-\n-### Streaming\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"Diagram showing parallelization of route segments during streaming, showing data fetching, rendering, and hydration of individual chunks.\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/sequential-parallel-data-fetching.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/sequential-parallel-data-fetching.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"525\"\n-/>\n-\n-Streaming enables you to progressively render UI from the server. Work is split into chunks and streamed to the client as it becomes ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page immediately, before the entire content has finished rendering.\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"Diagram showing partially rendered page on the client, with loading UI for chunks that are being streamed.\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"785\"\n-/>\n-\n-Streaming is built into the Next.js App Router by default. This helps improve both the initial page loading performance, as well as UI that depends on slower data fetches that would block rendering the whole route. For example, reviews on a product page.\n-\n-You can start streaming route segments using `loading.js` and UI components with [React Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming). See the [Loading UI and Streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) section for more information."

This means that by defining a `'use client'` in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle. The props of components exported from a file with the `'use client'` directive must be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types) by React to allow data to be passed from the server to the client across the boundary.\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/counter.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useState } from 'react'\n-\n-export default function Counter() {\n-  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n-      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/counter.js\" highlight={1} switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useState } from 'react'\n-\n-export default function Counter() {\n-  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n-      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-The diagram below shows that using `onClick` and `useState` in a nested component (`toggle.js`) will cause an error if the `'use client'` directive is not defined. This is because, by default, all components in the App Router are Server Components where these APIs are not available. By defining the `'use client'` directive in `toggle.js`, you can tell React to enter the client boundary where these APIs are available.\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"Use Client Directive and Network Boundary\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/use-client-directive.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/use-client-directive.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"1320\"\n-/>\n-\n-> **Defining multiple `'use client'` entry points**:\n->\n-> You can define multiple `'use client'` entry points in your React Component tree. This allows you to split your application into multiple client bundles.\n->\n-> However, `'use client'` doesn't need to be defined in every component that needs to be rendered on the client. Once you define the boundary, all child components and modules imported into it are considered part of the client bundle.\n-\n-## How are Client Components Rendered?\n-\n-In Next.js, Client Components are rendered differently depending on whether the request is part of a full page load (an initial visit to your application or a page reload triggered by a browser refresh) or a subsequent navigation.\n-\n-### Full page load\n-\n-To optimize the initial page load, Next.js will use React's APIs to render a static HTML preview on the server for both Client and Server Components. This means, when the user first visits your application, they will see the content of the page immediately, without having to wait for the client to download, parse, and execute the Client Component JavaScript bundle.\n-\n-On the server:\n-\n-1. React renders Server Components into a special data format called the [**React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload)**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc), which includes references to Client Components.\n-2. Next.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render **HTML** for the route on the server.\n-\n-Then, on the client:\n-\n-1. The HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive initial preview of the route.\n-2. The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\n-3. The JavaScript instructions are used to [hydrate](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Client Components and make their UI interactive.\n-\n-> **What is hydration?**\n->\n-> Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive. Behind the scenes, hydration is done with the [`hydrateRoot`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) React API.\n-\n-### Subsequent Navigations\n-\n-On subsequent navigations, Client Components are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.\n-\n-This means the Client Component JavaScript bundle is downloaded and parsed. Once the bundle is ready, React will use the [RSC Payload](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc) to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\n-\n-## Going back to the Server Environment\n-\n-Sometimes, after you've declared the `'use client'` boundary, you may want to go back to the server environment. For example, you may want to reduce the client bundle size, fetch data on the server, or use an API that is only available on the server.\n-\n-You can keep code on the server even though it's theoretically nested inside Client Components by interleaving Client and Server Components and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations). See the [Composition Patterns](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns) page for more information."

For example, you may have a layout and a page that depend on the same data.\n-\n-Instead of using [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) (which is not available on the server) or passing data as props, you can use `fetch` or React's `cache` function to fetch the same data in the components that need it, without worrying about making duplicate requests for the same data. This is because React extends `fetch` to automatically memoize data requests, and the `cache` function can be used when `fetch` is not available.\n-\n-[View an example](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching#reusing-data-across-multiple-functions) of this pattern.\n-\n-### Keeping Server-only Code out of the Client Environment\n-\n-Since JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules, it's possible for code that was only ever intended to be run on the server to sneak its way into the client.\n-\n-For example, take the following data-fetching function:\n-\n-```ts filename=\"lib/data.ts\" switcher\n-export async function getData() {\n-  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n-    headers: {\n-      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n-    },\n-  })\n-\n-  return res.json()\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```js filename=\"lib/data.js\" switcher\n-export async function getData() {\n-  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n-    headers: {\n-      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n-    },\n-  })\n-\n-  return res.json()\n-}\n-```\n-\n-At first glance, it appears that `getData` works on both the server and the client. However, this function contains an `API_KEY`, written with the intention that it would only ever be executed on the server.\n-\n-Since the environment variable `API_KEY` is not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`, it's a private variable that can only be accessed on the server. To prevent your environment variables from being leaked to the client, Next.js replaces private environment variables with an empty string.\n-\n-As a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected. And while making the variable public would make the function work on the client, you may not want to expose sensitive information to the client.\n-\n-To prevent this sort of unintended client usage of server code, we can use the `server-only` package to give other developers a build-time error if they ever accidentally import one of these modules into a Client Component.\n-\n-To use `server-only`, first install the package:\n-\n-```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n-npm install server-only\n-```\n-\n-Then import the package into any module that contains server-only code:\n-\n-```js filename=\"lib/data.js\"\n-import 'server-only'\n-\n-export async function getData() {\n-  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n-    headers: {\n-      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n-    },\n-  })\n-\n-  return res.json()\n-}\n-```\n-\n-Now, any Client Component that imports `getData()` will receive a build-time error explaining that this module can only be used on the server.\n-\n-The corresponding package `client-only` can be used to mark modules that contain client-only code – for example, code that accesses the `window` object.\n-\n-### Using Third-party Packages and Providers\n-\n-Since Server Components are a new React feature, third-party packages and providers in the ecosystem are just beginning to add the `'use client'` directive to components that use client-only features like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `createContext`.\n-\n-Today, many components from `npm` packages that use client-only features do not yet have the directive. These third-party components will work as expected within Client Components since they have the `'use client'` directive, but they won't work within Server Components.\n-\n-For example, let's say you've installed the hypothetical `acme-carousel` package which has a `<Carousel />` component. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `'use client'` directive.\n-\n-If you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/gallery.tsx\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useState } from 'react'\n-import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n-\n-export default function Gallery() {\n-  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n-\n-      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n-      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/gallery.js\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useState } from 'react'\n-import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n-\n-export default function Gallery() {\n-  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n-\n-      {/*  Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n-      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-However, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n-import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <p>View pictures</p>\n-\n-      {/* Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}\n-      <Carousel />\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n-import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <p>View pictures</p>\n-\n-      {/*  Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}\n-      <Carousel />\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-This is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.\n-\n-To fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/carousel.tsx\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n-\n-export default Carousel\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/carousel.js\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n-\n-export default Carousel\n-```\n-\n-Now, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n-import Carousel from './carousel'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <p>View pictures</p>\n-\n-      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n-      <Carousel />\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n-import Carousel from './carousel'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return (\n-    <div>\n-      <p>View pictures</p>\n-\n-      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n-      <Carousel />\n-    </div>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-We don't expect you to need to wrap most third-party components since it's likely you'll be using them within Client Components. However, one exception is providers, since they rely on React state and context, and are typically needed at the root of an application. [Learn more about third-party context providers below](#using-context-providers).\n-\n-#### Using Context Providers\n-\n-Context providers are typically rendered near the root of an application to share global concerns, like the current theme. Since [React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is not supported in Server Components, trying to create a context at the root of your application will cause an error:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n-import { createContext } from 'react'\n-\n-//  createContext is not supported in Server Components\n-export const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n-\n-export default function RootLayout({\n-  children,\n-}: {\n-  children: React.ReactNode\n-}) {\n-  return (\n-    <html>\n-      <body>\n-        <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n-      </body>\n-    </html>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n-import { createContext } from 'react'\n-\n-//  createContext is not supported in Server Components\n-export const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n-\n-export default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n-  return (\n-    <html>\n-      <body>\n-        <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n-      </body>\n-    </html>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-To fix this, create your context and render its provider inside of a Client Component:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/theme-provider.tsx\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { createContext } from 'react'\n-\n-export const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n-\n-export default function ThemeProvider({\n-  children,\n-}: {\n-  children: React.ReactNode\n-}) {\n-  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/theme-provider.js\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { createContext } from 'react'\n-\n-export const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n-\n-export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {\n-  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n-}\n-```\n-\n-Your Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider since it's been marked as a Client Component:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n-import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n-\n-export default function RootLayout({\n-  children,\n-}: {\n-  children: React.ReactNode\n-}) {\n-  return (\n-    <html>\n-      <body>\n-        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n-      </body>\n-    </html>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n-import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n-\n-export default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n-  return (\n-    <html>\n-      <body>\n-        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n-      </body>\n-    </html>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-With the provider rendered at the root, all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.\n-\n-> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.\n-\n-#### Advice for Library Authors\n-\n-In a similar fashion, library authors creating packages to be consumed by other developers can use the `'use client'` directive to mark client entry points of their package. This allows users of the package to import package components directly into their Server Components without having to create a wrapping boundary.\n-\n-You can optimize your package by using ['use client' deeper in the tree](#moving-client-components-down-the-tree), allowing the imported modules to be part of the Server Component module graph.\n-\n-It's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `'use client'` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `'use client'` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.\n-\n-## Client Components\n-\n-### Moving Client Components Down the Tree\n-\n-To reduce the Client JavaScript bundle size, we recommend moving Client Components down your component tree.\n-\n-For example, you may have a Layout that has static elements (e.g. logo, links, etc) and an interactive search bar that uses state.\n-\n-Instead of making the whole layout a Client Component, move the interactive logic to a Client Component (e.g. `<SearchBar />`) and keep your layout as a Server Component. This means you don't have to send all the component JavaScript of the layout to the client.\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n-// SearchBar is a Client Component\n-import SearchBar from './searchbar'\n-// Logo is a Server Component\n-import Logo from './logo'\n-\n-// Layout is a Server Component by default\n-export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <nav>\n-        <Logo />\n-        <SearchBar />\n-      </nav>\n-      <main>{children}</main>\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n-// SearchBar is a Client Component\n-import SearchBar from './searchbar'\n-// Logo is a Server Component\n-import Logo from './logo'\n-\n-// Layout is a Server Component by default\n-export default function Layout({ children }) {\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <nav>\n-        <Logo />\n-        <SearchBar />\n-      </nav>\n-      <main>{children}</main>\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-### Passing props from Server to Client Components (Serialization)\n-\n-If you fetch data in a Server Component, you may want to pass data down as props to Client Components. Props passed from the Server to Client Components need to be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values) by React.\n-\n-If your Client Components depend on data that is _not_ serializable, you can [fetch data on the client with a third party library](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching#fetching-data-on-the-client) or on the server with a [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).\n-\n-## Interleaving Server and Client Components\n-\n-When interleaving Client and Server Components, it may be helpful to visualize your UI as a tree of components. Starting with the [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required), which is a Server Component, you can then render certain subtrees of components on the client by adding the `'use client'` directive.\n-\n-{/* Diagram - interleaving */}\n-\n-Within those client subtrees, you can still nest Server Components or call Server Actions, however there are some things to keep in mind:\n-\n-- During a request-response lifecycle, your code moves from the server to the client. If you need to access data or resources on the server while on the client, you'll be making a **new** request to the server - not switching back and forth.\n-- When a new request is made to the server, all Server Components are rendered first, including those nested inside Client Components. The rendered result ([RSC Payload](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc)) will contain references to the locations of Client Components. Then, on the client, React uses the RSC Payload to reconcile Server and Client Components into a single tree.\n-\n-{/* Diagram */}\n-\n-- Since Client Components are rendered after Server Components, you cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component module (since it would require a new request back to the server). Instead, you can pass a Server Component as `props` to a Client Component. See the [unsupported pattern](#unsupported-pattern-importing-server-components-into-client-components) and [supported pattern](#supported-pattern-passing-server-components-to-client-components-as-props) sections below.\n-\n-### Unsupported Pattern: Importing Server Components into Client Components\n-\n-The following pattern is not supported. You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/client-component.tsx\" switcher highlight={3,4,17}\n-'use client'\n-\n-// You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component.\n-import ServerComponent from './Server-Component'\n-\n-export default function ClientComponent({\n-  children,\n-}: {\n-  children: React.ReactNode\n-}) {\n-  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n-\n-      <ServerComponent />\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/client-component.js\" switcher highlight={3,13}\n-'use client'\n-\n-// You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component.\n-import ServerComponent from './Server-Component'\n-\n-export default function ClientComponent({ children }) {\n-  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n-\n-      <ServerComponent />\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-### Supported Pattern: Passing Server Components to Client Components as Props\n-\n-The following pattern is supported. You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component.\n-\n-A common pattern is to use the React `children` prop to create a _\"slot\"_ in your Client Component.\n-\n-In the example below, `<ClientComponent>` accepts a `children` prop:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/client-component.tsx\" switcher highlight={6,15}\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useState } from 'react'\n-\n-export default function ClientComponent({\n-  children,\n-}: {\n-  children: React.ReactNode\n-}) {\n-  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n-      {children}\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/client-component.js\" switcher highlight={5,12}\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useState } from 'react'\n-\n-export default function ClientComponent({ children }) {\n-  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n-\n-      {children}\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-`<ClientComponent>` doesn't know that `children` will eventually be filled in by the result of a Server Component. The only responsibility `<ClientComponent>` has is to decide **where** `children` will eventually be placed.\n-\n-In a parent Server Component, you can import both the `<ClientComponent>` and `<ServerComponent>` and pass `<ServerComponent>` as a child of `<ClientComponent>`:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\"  highlight={11} switcher\n-// This pattern works:\n-// You can pass a Server Component as a child or prop of a\n-// Client Component.\n-import ClientComponent from './client-component'\n-import ServerComponent from './server-component'\n-\n-// Pages in Next.js are Server Components by default\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return (\n-    <ClientComponent>\n-      <ServerComponent />\n-    </ClientComponent>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" highlight={11} switcher\n-// This pattern works:\n-// You can pass a Server Component as a child or prop of a\n-// Client Component.\n-import ClientComponent from './client-component'\n-import ServerComponent from './server-component'\n-\n-// Pages in Next.js are Server Components by default\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return (\n-    <ClientComponent>\n-      <ServerComponent />\n-    </ClientComponent>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-With this approach, `<ClientComponent>` and `<ServerComponent>` are decoupled and can be rendered independently. In this case, the child `<ServerComponent>` can be rendered on the server, well before `<ClientComponent>` is rendered on the client.\n-\n-> **Good to know:**\n->\n-> - The pattern of \"lifting content up\" has been used to avoid re-rendering a nested child component when a parent component re-renders.\n-> - You're not limited to the `children` prop. You can use any prop to pass JSX."
