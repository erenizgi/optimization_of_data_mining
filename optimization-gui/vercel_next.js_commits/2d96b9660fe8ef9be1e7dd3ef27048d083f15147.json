    "message": "docs: add pageExtensions note to Middleware and clarify default filename (#84045)\n\n- Added a Note to the Middleware docs explaining that when\n`pageExtensions` are customized (e.g. `.page.ts`), the Middleware file\nshould be named `middleware.page.ts` or `middleware.page.js`.\n- Updated wording so `middleware.ts/js` is described as the default\nfilename, not a strict requirement.\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!
