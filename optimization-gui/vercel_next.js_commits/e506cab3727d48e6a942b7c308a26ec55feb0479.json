The long-term solution would be to stop shipping certs once https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2159 is fixed.\n- ~`webpki-roots 0.26.11` is just a dumb re-export of `1.x`, so this avoids shipping the CA roots twice! https://github.com/rustls/webpki-roots/releases/tag/v%2F0.26.11  -- Should save a few hundred KBs~ **Edit:** This dependency was removed by the latest swc+wasmer update.",
