Even if it is, it needs to be fixed\nin the caller, because it means the type is incorrect.\n\nI have a suspicion that it was added before the fix to `useMergedRef`\nlanded here: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/75088\n\nIf it turns out that this argument is still sometimes `null`, it\nsuggests that there's a bug in `useMergedRef` and we need to fix it\nthere.",
