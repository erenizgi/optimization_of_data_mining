    "message": "docs:Small improvement on the contribution guide for clarity (#84200)\n\n### What?\nImproves the contribution guide (`01-contribution-guide.mdx`) by fixing\na typo and clarifying wording for JavaScript files with JSX code.\n\n### Why?\nThis is my first time ontributing to open source, i've taken my time to\nread the contribution guide and noticed this small inconsisntency. My\nmotivation was to start small by fixing this issue and make a\ncontribution, with the intention of following up with greater\nimprovements later. This change also helps make the documentation\nclearer for new contributors and keeps it aligned with the Next.js style\nguide.\n\n### How?\n**Before:**\n> - Make sure to use `js` extension with JSX code at JavaScript files.\n\n**After:**\n> - Make sure to use `.js` extension for JavaScript files with **JSX**\ncode.\n\nCo-authored-by: Joseph <joseph.chamochumbi@vercel.com>",
