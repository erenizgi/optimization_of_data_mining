Generally, the solution is easy, e.g. have `button.module.css` `@import utils.module.css` to force the ordering, or identify the conflicting rules and change them to not target the same properties.\n \n+### Sass node_modules imports\n+\n+Turbopack supports importing `node_modules` Sass files out of the box. Webpack supports a legacy tilde `~` syntax for this, which is not supported by Turbopack.\n+\n+From:\n+\n+```scss filename=\"styles/globals.scss\"\n+@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n+```\n+\n+To:\n+\n+```scss filename=\"styles/globals.scss\"\n+@import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n+```\n+\n+If you can't update the imports, you can add a `turbopack.resolveAlias` configuration to map the `~` syntax to the actual path:\n+\n+```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n+module.exports = {\n+  turbopack: {\n+    resolveAlias: {\n+      '~*': '*',\n+    },\n+  },\n+}\n+```\n+\n ### Bundle Sizes\n \n From our testing on production applications, we observed that Turbopack generally produces bundles that are similar in size to Webpack. However, the comparison can be difficult since turbopack tends to produce fewer but larger chunks. Our advice is to focus on higher level metrics like [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) or your own application level metrics to compare performance across the two bundlers. We are however aware of one gap that can occasionally cause a large regression."
