A reverse proxy can handle malformed requests, slow connection attacks, payload size limits, rate limiting, and other security concerns, offloading these tasks from the Next.js server. This allows the server to dedicate its resources to rendering rather than request validation.\n+\n ## Image Optimization\n \n [Image Optimization](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) through `next/image` works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using `next start`.
