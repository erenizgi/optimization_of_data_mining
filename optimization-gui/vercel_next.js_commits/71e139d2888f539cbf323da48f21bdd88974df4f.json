These sources are meant to be built inside the `packages/next/dist/...` directory. The outputs will include compiled JavaScript files and source maps.\n+\n+### Bundle the Project with Webpack\n+\n+Based on the outputs of the compilation, the project is then bundled with Webpack. The configuration can be found in the [`next-runtime.webpack-config.js`](../../packages/next/next-runtime.webpack-config.js) file.\n+\n+### Generate the Type Definitions\n+\n+The type definitions are generated using the TypeScript [`tsc`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) compiler. You can build them separately with `pnpm types`. The [`tsconfig.build.json`](../../packages/next/tsconfig.build.json) is used which extends the base [`tsconfig.json`](../../packages/next/tsconfig.json) but excludes test files and other unneeded type definitions.\n+\n+## Working on Turbopack, WASM, and other Rust code\n+\n+If you are actively working on Rust code or you need to test out the most recent Rust code that hasn't been published as a canary yet, you can [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run `pnpm swc-build-native`.\n \n If you want to test out the wasm build locally, you will need to [install wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/). Run `pnpm --filter=@next/swc build-wasm --target <wasm_target>` to build and `node ./scripts/setup-wasm.mjs` to copy it into your `node_modules`. Run next with `NODE_OPTIONS='--no-addons'` to force it to use the wasm binary.\n "
