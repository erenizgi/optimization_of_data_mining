This often means the client has to wait for a server response before a new route can be shown. Next.js comes built-in [prefetching](#prefetching), [streaming](#streaming), and [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions) ensuring navigation stays fast and responsive.\n+\n+This guide explains how navigation works in Next.js and how you can optimize it for [dynamic routes](#dynamic-routes-without-loadingtsx) and [slow networks](#slow-networks).\n+\n+## How navigation works\n+\n+To understand how navigation works in Next.js, it helps to be familiar with the following concepts:\n+\n+- [Server Rendering](#server-rendering)\n+- [Prefetching](#prefetching)\n+- [Streaming](#streaming)\n+- [Client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions)\n+\n+### Server Rendering\n+\n+In Next.js, [Layouts and Pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages) are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. On initial and subsequent navigations, the [Server Component Payload](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components#how-do-server-and-client-components-work-in-nextjs) is generated on the server before being sent to the client.\n+\n+There are two types of server rendering, based on _when_ it happens:\n+\n+- **Static Rendering (or Prerendering)** happens at build time or during [revalidation](/docs/app/getting-started/caching-and-revalidating) and the result is cached.\n+- **Dynamic Rendering** happens at request time in response to a client request.\n+\n+The trade-off of server rendering is that the client must wait for the server to respond before the new route can be shown. Next.js addresses this delay by [pretching](#prefetching) routes the user is likely to visit and performing [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions).\n+\n+> **Good to know**: HTML is also generated for the initial visit.\n+\n+### Prefetching\n+\n+Prefetching is the process of loading a route in the background before the user navigates to it. This makes navigation between routes in your application feel instant, because by the time a user clicks on a link, the data to render the next route is already available client side.\n+\n+Next.js automatically prefetches routes linked with the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) when they enter the user's viewport.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n+import Link from 'next/link'\n+\n+export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n+  return (\n+    <html>\n+      <body>\n+        <nav>\n+          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}\n+          <Link href=\"/blog\">Blog</Link>\n+          {/* No prefetching */}\n+          <a href=\"/contact\">Contact</a>\n+        </nav>\n+        {children}\n+      </body>\n+    </html>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/blog/page.js\" switcher\n+import Link from 'next/link'\n+\n+export default function Layout() {\n+  return (\n+    <html>\n+      <body>\n+        <nav>\n+          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}\n+          <Link href=\"/blog\">Blog</Link>\n+          {/* No prefetching */}\n+          <a href=\"/contact\">Contact</a>\n+        </nav>\n+        {children}\n+      </body>\n+    </html>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+How much of the route is prefetched depends on whether it's static or dynamic:\n+\n+- **Static Route**: the full route is prefetched.\n+- **Dynamic Route**: prefetching is skipped, or the route is partially prefetched if [`loading.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) is present.\n+\n+By skipping or partially prefetching dynamic routes, Next.js avoids unnecessary work on the server for routes the users may never visit. However, waiting for a server response before navigation can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.\n+\n+<Image\n+  alt=\"Server Rendering without Streaming\"\n+  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming.png\"\n+  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-without-streaming.png\"\n+  width=\"1600\"\n+  height=\"748\"\n+/>\n+\n+To improve the navigation experience to dynamic routes, you can use [streaming](#streaming).\n+\n+### Streaming\n+\n+Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client as soon as they're ready, rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered. This means users see something sooner, even if parts of the page are still loading.\n+\n+For dynamic routes, it means they can be **partially prefetched**. That is, shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.\n+\n+<Image\n+  alt=\"How Server Rendering with Streaming Works\"\n+  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n+  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n+  width=\"1600\"\n+  height=\"785\"\n+/>\n+\n+To use streaming, create a `loading.tsx` in your route folder:\n+\n+<Image\n+  alt=\"loading.js special file\"\n+  srcLight=\"/docs/light/loading-special-file.png\"\n+  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/loading-special-file.png\"\n+  width=\"1600\"\n+  height=\"606\"\n+/>\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/loading.tsx\" switcher\n+export default function Loading() {\n+  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.\n+  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/loading.js\" switcher\n+export default function Loading() {\n+  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.\n+  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Behind the scenes, Next.js will automatically wrap the `page.tsx` contents and in a `<Suspense>` boundary. The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.\n+\n+> **Good to know**: You can also use [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to create loading UI for nested components.\n+\n+Benefits of `loading.tsx`:\n+\n+- Immediate navigation and visual feedback for the user.\n+- Shared layouts remain interactive and navigation is interruptible.\n+- Improved Core Web Vitals: [TTFB](https://web.dev/articles/ttfb), [FCP](https://web.dev/articles/fcp), and [TTI](https://web.dev/articles/tti).\n+\n+To further improve the navigation experience, Next.js performs a [client-side transition](#client-side-transitions) with the `<Link>` component.\n+\n+### Client-side transitions\n+\n+Traditionally, navigation to a server-rendered page triggers a full page load. This clears state, resets scroll position, and blocks interactivity.\n+\n+Next.js avoids this with client-side transitions using the `<Link>` component. Instead of reloading the page, it updates the content dynamically by:\n+\n+- Keeping any shared layouts and UI.\n+- Replacing the current page with the prefetched loading state or a new page if available.\n+\n+Client-side transitions are what makes a server-rendered apps _feel_ like client-rendered apps. And when paired with [prefetching](#prefetching) and [streaming](#streaming), it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.\n+\n+## What can make transitions slow?\n+\n+These Next.js optimizations make navigation fast and responsive. However, under certain conditions, transitions can still _feel_ slow. Here are some common causes and how to improve the user experience:\n+\n+### Dynamic routes without `loading.tsx`\n+\n+When navigating to a dynamic route, the client must wait for the server response before showing the result. This can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.\n+\n+We recommend adding `loading.tsx` to dynamic routes to enable partial prefetching, trigger immediate navigation, and display a loading UI while the route renders.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/loading.tsx\" switcher\n+export default function Loading() {\n+  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/loading.js\" switcher\n+export default function Loading() {\n+  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n+}\n+```\n+\n+> **Good to know**: In development mode, you can use the Next.js Devtools to identify if the route is static or dynamic. See [`devIndicators`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/devIndicators) for more information.\n+\n+### Dynamic segments without `generateStaticParams`\n+\n+If a [dynamic segment](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) could be prerendered but isn't because it's missing [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params), the route will fallback to dynamic rendering at request time.\n+\n+Ensure the route is statically generated at build time by adding `generateStaticParams`:\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\" switcher\n+export async function generateStaticParams() {\n+  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())\n+\n+  return posts.map((post) => ({\n+    slug: post.slug,\n+  }))\n+}\n+\n+export default async function Page({\n+  params,\n+}: {\n+  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n+}) {\n+  const { slug } = await params\n+  // ...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.js\" switcher\n+export async function generateStaticParams() {\n+  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())\n+\n+  return posts.map((post) => ({\n+    slug: post.slug,\n+  }))\n+\n+export default async function Page({ params }) {\n+  const { slug } = await params\n+  // ...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Slow networks\n+\n+On slow or unstable networks, prefetching may not finish before the user clicks a link. This can affect both static and dynamic routes. In these cases, the `loading.js` fallback may not appear immediately because it hasn't been prefetched yet.\n+\n+To improve perceived performance, you can use the [`useLinkStatus` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status) to show inline visual feedback to the user (like spinners or text glimmers on the link) while a transition is in progress.\n+\n+```tsx\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'\n+\n+export default function LoadingIndicator() {\n+  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()\n+  return pending ?

(\n+    <div role=\"status\" aria-label=\"Loading\" className=\"spinner\" />\n+  ) : null\n+}\n+```\n+\n+You can \"debounce\" the loading indicator by adding an initial animation delay (e.g. 100ms) and starting the animation as invisible (e.g. `opacity: 0`). This means the loading indicator will only be shown if the navigation takes longer than the specified delay.\n+\n+```css\n+.spinner {\n+  /* ... */\n+  opacity: 0;\n+  animation:\n+    fadeIn 500ms 100ms forwards,\n+    rotate 1s linear infinite;\n+}\n+\n+@keyframes fadeIn {\n+  from {\n+    opacity: 0;\n+  }\n+  to {\n+    opacity: 1;\n+  }\n+}\n+\n+@keyframes rotate {\n+  to {\n+    transform: rotate(360deg);\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+> **Good to know**: You can use other visual feedback patterns like a progress bar. View an example [here](https://github.com/vercel/react-transition-progress).\n+\n+### Disabling prefetching\n+\n+You can opt out of prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false` on the `<Link>` component. This is useful to avoid unnecessary usage of resources when rendering large lists of links (e.g. an infinite scroll table).\n+\n+```tsx\n+<Link prefetch={false} href=\"/blog\">\n+  Blog\n+</Link>\n+```\n+\n+However, disabling prefetching comes with trade-offs:\n+\n+- **Static routes** will only be fetched when the user clicks the link.\n+- **Dynamic routes** will need to be rendered on the server first before the client can navigate to it.\n+\n+To reduce resouce usage without fully disabling prefetch, you can prefetch only on hover. This limits prefetching to routes the user is more _likely_ to visit, rather all links in the viewport.\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.tsx\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import Link from 'next/link'\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+\n+function HoverPrefetchLink({\n+  href,\n+  children,\n+}: {\n+  href: string\n+  children: React.ReactNode\n+}) {\n+  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <Link\n+      href={href}\n+      prefetch={active ? null : false}\n+      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}\n+    >\n+      {children}\n+    </Link>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.js\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import Link from 'next/link'\n+import { useState } from 'react'\n+\n+function HoverPrefetchLink({ href, children }) {\n+  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)\n+\n+  return (\n+    <Link\n+      href={href}\n+      prefetch={active ? null : false}\n+      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}\n+    >\n+      {children}\n+    </Link>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Hydration not completed\n+\n+`<Link>` is a Client Component and must be hydrated before it can prefetch routes. On the initial visit, large JavaScript bundles can delay hydration, preventing prefetching from starting right away.\n+\n+React mitigates this with Selective Hydration and you can further improve this by:\n+\n+- Using the [`@next/bundle-analyzer`](/docs/app/guides/package-bundling#analyzing-javascript-bundles) plugin to identify and reduce bundle size by removing large dependencies.\n+- Moving logic from the client to the server where possible. See the [Server and Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) docs for guidance.\n+\n+## Examples\n+\n+### Native History API\n+\n+Next.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.\n+\n+`pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).\n+\n+#### `window.history.pushState`\n+\n+Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:\n+\n+```tsx fileName=\"app/ui/sort-products.tsx\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n+\n+export default function SortProducts() {\n+  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n+\n+  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {\n+    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n+    params.set('sort', sortOrder)\n+    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)\n+  }\n+\n+  return (\n+    <>\n+      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>\n+      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>\n+    </>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx fileName=\"app/ui/sort-products.js\" switcher\n+'use client'\n+\n+import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n+\n+export default function SortProducts() {\n+  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n+\n+  function updateSorting(sortOrder) {\n+    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n+    params.set('sort', sortOrder)\n+    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)\n+  }\n+\n+  return (\n+    <>\n+      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>\n+      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>\n+    </>\n+  )\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### `window.history.replaceState`\n+\n+Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack.

It is the primary and recommended way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n-\n-You can use it by importing it from `next/link`, and passing a `href` prop to the component:\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n-import Link from 'next/link'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return <Link href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</Link>\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n-import Link from 'next/link'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  return <Link href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</Link>\n-}\n-```\n-\n-There are other optional props you can pass to `<Link>`. See the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) for more.\n-\n-## `useRouter()` hook\n-\n-The `useRouter` hook allows you to programmatically change routes from [Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components).\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  const router = useRouter()\n-\n-  return (\n-    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n-      Dashboard\n-    </button>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-export default function Page() {\n-  const router = useRouter()\n-\n-  return (\n-    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n-      Dashboard\n-    </button>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-For a full list of `useRouter` methods, see the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n-\n-> **Recommendation:** Use the `<Link>` component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using `useRouter`.\n-\n-## `redirect` function\n-\n-For [Server Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components), use the `redirect` function instead.\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/team/[id]/page.tsx\" switcher\n-import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-async function fetchTeam(id: string) {\n-  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n-  if (!res.ok) return undefined\n-  return res.json()\n-}\n-\n-export default async function Profile({\n-  params,\n-}: {\n-  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n-}) {\n-  const { id } = await params\n-  if (!id) {\n-    redirect('/login')\n-  }\n-\n-  const team = await fetchTeam(id)\n-  if (!team) {\n-    redirect('/join')\n-  }\n-\n-  // ...\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/team/[id]/page.js\" switcher\n-import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-async function fetchTeam(id) {\n-  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n-  if (!res.ok) return undefined\n-  return res.json()\n-}\n-\n-export default async function Profile({ params }) {\n-  const { id } = await params\n-  if (!id) {\n-    redirect('/login')\n-  }\n-\n-  const team = await fetchTeam(id)\n-  if (!team) {\n-    redirect('/join')\n-  }\n-\n-  // ...\n-}\n-```\n-\n-> **Good to know**:\n->\n-> - `redirect` returns a 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code by default. When used in a Server Action, it returns a 303 (See Other), which is commonly used for redirecting to a success page as a result of a POST request.\n-> - `redirect` internally throws an error so it should be called outside of `try/catch` blocks.\n-> - `redirect` can be called in Client Components during the rendering process but not in event handlers. You can use the [`useRouter` hook](#userouter-hook) instead.\n-> - `redirect` also accepts absolute URLs and can be used to redirect to external links.\n-> - If you'd like to redirect before the render process, use [`next.config.js`](/docs/app/guides/redirecting#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) or [Middleware](/docs/app/guides/redirecting#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware).\n-\n-See the [`redirect` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) for more information.\n-\n-## Using the native History API\n-\n-Next.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.\n-\n-`pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).\n-\n-### `window.history.pushState`\n-\n-Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:\n-\n-```tsx fileName=\"app/ui/sort-products.tsx\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-export default function SortProducts() {\n-  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n-\n-  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {\n-    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n-    params.set('sort', sortOrder)\n-    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)\n-  }\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>\n-      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx fileName=\"app/ui/sort-products.js\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-export default function SortProducts() {\n-  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n-\n-  function updateSorting(sortOrder) {\n-    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n-    params.set('sort', sortOrder)\n-    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)\n-  }\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>\n-      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-### `window.history.replaceState`\n-\n-Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:\n-\n-```tsx fileName=\"app/ui/locale-switcher.tsx\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-export function LocaleSwitcher() {\n-  const pathname = usePathname()\n-\n-  function switchLocale(locale: string) {\n-    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'\n-    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`\n-    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)\n-  }\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>\n-      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx fileName=\"app/ui/locale-switcher.js\" switcher\n-'use client'\n-\n-import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\n-\n-export function LocaleSwitcher() {\n-  const pathname = usePathname()\n-\n-  function switchLocale(locale) {\n-    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'\n-    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`\n-    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)\n-  }\n-\n-  return (\n-    <>\n-      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>\n-      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>\n-    </>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-## How Routing and Navigation Works\n-\n-The App Router uses a hybrid approach for routing and navigation. On the server, your application code is automatically [code-split](#1-code-splitting) by route segments. And on the client, Next.js [prefetches](#2-prefetching) and [caches](#3-caching) the route segments. This means, when a user navigates to a new route, the browser doesn't reload the page, and only the route segments that change re-render - improving the navigation experience and performance.\n-\n-### 1. Code Splitting\n-\n-Code splitting allows you to split your application code into smaller bundles to be downloaded and executed by the browser. This reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time for each request, leading to improved performance.\n-\n-[Server Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) allow your application code to be automatically code-split by route segments. This means only the code needed for the current route is loaded on navigation.\n-\n-### 2. Prefetching\n-\n-Prefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before the user visits it.\n-\n-There are two ways routes are prefetched in Next.js:\n-\n-- **`<Link>` component**: Routes are automatically prefetched as they become visible in the user's viewport. Prefetching happens when the page first loads or when it comes into view through scrolling.\n-- **`router.prefetch()`**: The `useRouter` hook can be used to prefetch routes programmatically.\n-\n-The `<Link>`'s default prefetching behavior (i.e. when the `prefetch` prop is left unspecified or set to `null`) is different depending on your usage of [`loading.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading). Only the shared layout, down the rendered \"tree\" of components until the first `loading.js` file, is prefetched and cached for `30s`. This reduces the cost of fetching an entire dynamic route, and it means you can show an [instant loading state](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states) for better visual feedback to users.\n-\n-You can disable prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false`. Alternatively, you can prefetch the full page data beyond the loading boundaries by setting the `prefetch` prop to `true`.\n-\n-See the [`<Link>` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) for more information.\n-\n-> **Good to know**:\n->\n-> - Prefetching is not enabled in development, only in production.\n-\n-### 3. Caching\n-\n-Next.js has an **in-memory client-side cache** called the [Router Cache](/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#client-side-router-cache). As users navigate around the app, the React Server Component Payload of [prefetched](#2-prefetching) route segments and visited routes are stored in the cache.\n-\n-This means on navigation, the cache is reused as much as possible, instead of making a new request to the server - improving performance by reducing the number of requests and data transferred.\n-\n-Learn more about how the [Router Cache](/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#client-side-router-cache) works and how to configure it.\n-\n-### 4. Partial Rendering\n-\n-Partial rendering means only the route segments that change on navigation re-render on the client, and any shared segments are preserved.\n-\n-For example, when navigating between two sibling routes, `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/analytics`, the `settings` page will be unmounted, the `analytics` page will be mounted with fresh state, and the shared `dashboard` layout will be preserved. This behavior is also present between two routes on the same dynamic segment e.g. with `/blog/[slug]/page` and navigating from `/blog/first` to `/blog/second`.\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"How partial rendering works\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/partial-rendering.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/partial-rendering.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"945\"\n-/>\n-\n-Without partial rendering, each navigation would cause the full page to re-render on the client. Rendering only the segment that changes reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved performance.\n-\n-### 5. Soft Navigation\n-\n-Browsers perform a \"hard navigation\" when navigating between pages. The Next.js App Router enables \"soft navigation\" between pages, ensuring only the route segments that have changed are re-rendered (partial rendering). This enables client React state to be preserved during navigation.\n-\n-### 6. Back and Forward Navigation\n-\n-By default, Next.js will maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation, and re-use route segments in the [Router Cache](/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#client-side-router-cache).\n-\n-### 7. Routing between `pages/` and `app/`\n-\n-When incrementally migrating from `pages/` to `app/`, the Next.js router will automatically handle hard navigation between the two. To detect transitions from `pages/` to `app/`, there is a client router filter that leverages probabilistic checking of app routes, which can occasionally result in false positives. By default, such occurrences should be very rare, as we configure the false positive likelihood to be 0.01%. This likelihood can be customized via the `experimental.clientRouterFilterAllowedRate` option in `next.config.js`. It's important to note that lowering the false positive rate will increase the size of the generated filter in the client bundle.\n-\n-Alternatively, if you prefer to disable this handling completely and manage the routing between `pages/` and `app/` manually, you can set `experimental.clientRouterFilter` to false in `next.config.js`. When this feature is disabled, any dynamic routes in pages that overlap with app routes won't be navigated to properly by default."

The App Router supports streaming with [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n-\n-> **Good to know**:\n->\n-> - [Some browsers](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252413) buffer a streaming response. You may not see the streamed response until the response exceeds 1024 bytes. This typically only affects “hello world” applications, but not real applications.\n-\n-### What is Streaming?\n-\n-To learn how Streaming works in React and Next.js, it's helpful to understand **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and its limitations.\n-\n-With SSR, there's a series of steps that need to be completed before a user can see and interact with a page:\n-\n-1. First, all data for a given page is fetched on the server.\n-2. The server then renders the HTML for the page.\n-3. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.\n-4. A non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS.\n-5. Finally, React [hydrates](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html) the user interface to make it interactive.\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"Chart showing Server Rendering without Streaming\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming-chart.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-without-streaming-chart.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"612\"\n-/>\n-\n-These steps are sequential and blocking, meaning the server can only render the HTML for a page once all the data has been fetched. And, on the client, React can only hydrate the UI once the code for all components in the page has been downloaded.\n-\n-SSR with React and Next.js helps improve the perceived loading performance by showing a non-interactive page to the user as soon as possible.\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"Server Rendering without Streaming\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-without-streaming.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"748\"\n-/>\n-\n-However, it can still be slow as all data fetching on server needs to be completed before the page can be shown to the user.\n-\n-**Streaming** allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"How Server Rendering with Streaming Works\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"785\"\n-/>\n-\n-This enables parts of the page to be displayed sooner, without waiting for all the data to load before any UI can be rendered.\n-\n-Streaming works well with React's component model because each component can be considered a chunk. Components that have higher priority (e.g. product information) or that don't rely on data can be sent first (e.g. layout), and React can start hydration earlier. Components that have lower priority (e.g. reviews, related products) can be sent in the same server request after their data has been fetched.\n-\n-<Image\n-  alt=\"Chart showing Server Rendering with Streaming\"\n-  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming-chart.png\"\n-  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-with-streaming-chart.png\"\n-  width=\"1600\"\n-  height=\"730\"\n-/>\n-\n-Streaming is particularly beneficial when you want to prevent long data requests from blocking the page from rendering as it can reduce the [Time To First Byte (TTFB)](https://web.dev/ttfb/) and [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/). It also helps improve [Time to Interactive (TTI)](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/), especially on slower devices.\n-\n-### Example\n-\n-`<Suspense>` works by wrapping a component that performs an asynchronous action (e.g. fetch data), showing fallback UI (e.g. skeleton, spinner) while it's happening, and then swapping in your component once the action completes.\n-\n-```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.tsx\" switcher\n-import { Suspense } from 'react'\n-import { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'\n-\n-export default function Posts() {\n-  return (\n-    <section>\n-      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n-        <PostFeed />\n-      </Suspense>\n-      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n-        <Weather />\n-      </Suspense>\n-    </section>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.js\" switcher\n-import { Suspense } from 'react'\n-import { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'\n-\n-export default function Posts() {\n-  return (\n-    <section>\n-      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n-        <PostFeed />\n-      </Suspense>\n-      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n-        <Weather />\n-      </Suspense>\n-    </section>\n-  )\n-}\n-```\n-\n-By using Suspense, you get the benefits of:\n-\n-1. **Streaming Server Rendering** - Progressively rendering HTML from the server to the client.\n-2. **Selective Hydration** - React prioritizes what components to make interactive first based on user interaction.\n-\n-For more Suspense examples and use cases, please see the [React Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n-\n-### SEO\n-\n-- Next.js will wait for data fetching inside [`generateMetadata`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) to complete before streaming UI to the client. This guarantees the first part of a streamed response includes `<head>` tags.\n-- Since streaming is server-rendered, it does not impact SEO. You can use the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) tool from Google to see how your page appears to Google's web crawlers and view the serialized HTML ([source](https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/#seo-considerations)).\n-\n-### Status Codes\n-\n-When streaming, a `200` status code will be returned to signal that the request was successful.\n-\n-The server can still communicate errors or issues to the client within the streamed content itself, for example, when using [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) or [`notFound`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found). Since the response headers have already been sent to the client, the status code of the response cannot be updated. This does not affect SEO.\n-\n-## Platform Support\n-\n-| Deployment Option                                                   | Supported         |\n-| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n-| [Node.js server](/docs/app/getting-started/deploying#nodejs-server) | Yes               |\n-| [Docker container](/docs/app/getting-started/deploying#docker)      | Yes               |\n-| [Static export](/docs/app/getting-started/deploying#static-export)  | No                |\n-| [Adapters](/docs/app/getting-started/deploying#adapters)            | Platform-specific |\n-\n-Learn how to [configure streaming](/docs/app/guides/self-hosting#streaming-and-suspense) when self-hosting Next.js."

You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.\n+\n+Create a loading state by adding a `loading.js` file inside a folder.\n+\n+<Image\n+  alt=\"loading.js special file\"\n+  srcLight=\"/docs/light/loading-special-file.png\"\n+  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/loading-special-file.png\"\n+  width=\"1600\"\n+  height=\"606\"\n+/>\n+\n+```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/loading.tsx\" switcher\n+export default function Loading() {\n+  // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.\n+  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/loading.js\" switcher\n+export default function Loading() {\n+  // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.\n+  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the same folder, `loading.js` will be nested inside `layout.js`.

This guarantees the first part of a streamed response includes `<head>` tags.\n+- Since streaming is server-rendered, it does not impact SEO. You can use the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) tool from Google to see how your page appears to Google's web crawlers and view the serialized HTML ([source](https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/#seo-considerations)).\n+\n+### Status Codes\n+\n+When streaming, a `200` status code will be returned to signal that the request was successful.\n+\n+The server can still communicate errors or issues to the client within the streamed content itself, for example, when using [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) or [`notFound`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found). Since the response headers have already been sent to the client, the status code of the response cannot be updated. This does not affect SEO.\n+\n+### Browser limits\n+\n+[Some browsers](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252413) buffer a streaming response.
