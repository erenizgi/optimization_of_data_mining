    "message": "Fix typed routes test expectations (#86487)\n\nFollow up to https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/86273\n\nThe typed routes test was checking for `/project/[slug]` in the\n`RedirectRoutes` type, but this route doesn't actually exist in the test\nfixture anymore. The test fixture only has redirects defined for\n`/blog/[category]/[[...slug]]`.\n\nWhen Next.js generates the typed routes during the build, it only\nincludes routes that actually exist in the project structure. The test\nwas expecting a route that wasn't present, which would cause the test to\nfail if the generated types were correct.\n\nThis removes `/project/[slug]` from the expected `RedirectRoutes` type\nso the test expectations match what's actually generated.\n\nAlso includes a minor formatting fix in\n`apps/bundle-analyzer/next-env.d.ts` to use consistent semicolons and\ndouble quotes per the project's style guidelines.",
