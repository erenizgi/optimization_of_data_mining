The `deleteItem()` method does have\n-a side effect: it deletes an item.\n+## What's next\n \n-Deleting an item updates the model, and depending on your code, triggers\n-other changes including queries and saving to a remote server.\n-These changes propagate through the system and ultimately display in this and other views.\n+For more information on how event binding works, see [How event binding works](guide/event-binding-concepts)."
