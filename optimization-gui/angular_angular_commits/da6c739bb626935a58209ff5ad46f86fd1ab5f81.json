    "message": "test(core): update test expectation to account for IE11 anonymous function name (#40342)\n\nThe \"monitoring\" workflow has been failing since #40127 was merged,\ndue to a Saucelabs test failure in Internet Explorer 11. The issue is\nwith the test's expectation which does not account for Ivy instruction\ninvocations to use \"anonymous\" instead of the instruction's function\nname. This commit changes the test expectation to also accept\n\"anonymous\", which was already the case for similar expectations.\n\nPR Close #40342",
