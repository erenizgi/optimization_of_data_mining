This commit removes a\nreference of the obsolete URL pattern to avoid confusion.\n\nExample old URL:\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/<build-number>#artifacts\n\nExample new URL:\nhttps://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/angular/angular/<build-number>/workflows/<workflow-id>/jobs/<job-id>/artifacts\n\nPR Close #38554",
