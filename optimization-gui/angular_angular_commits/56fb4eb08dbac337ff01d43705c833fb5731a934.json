Internally, watch mode is implemented via reuse of a `ts.Program` from the previous compile. When a `ts.Program` is reused, TypeScript determines which source files need to be re-typechecked and re-emitted, and performs those operations.\n \n This mode works for the Angular transformer and most of the decorator compilers, because they operate only using the metadata from one particular file. The exception is the `@Component` decorator, which requires the selector scope for the module in which the component is declared in. Effectively, this means that all components within a selector scope must be recompiled together, as any changes to the component selectors or type names, for example, will invalidate the compilation of all templates of all components in the scope. Since TypeScript will not track these changes, it's the responsibility of `ngtsc` to ensure the re-compilation of the right set of files.\n "
