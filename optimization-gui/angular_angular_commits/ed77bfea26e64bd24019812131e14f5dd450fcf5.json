    "message": "test(core): fix JIT factory declaration test for IE11 (#41416)\n\nThis commit removes a check for the name of the generated factory\nfunction, which is unimportant to test the behaviour of the code.\n\nThe name of these functions is generated from the name of the class\nbeing instantiated. In IE11, there is no `function.name` property available\nand so there is a shim for it in `third_party/shims_for_IE.js`, which patches\nthe `Function.property.name` property.\n\nFor performance reasons this shim writes the result of the computation\nto the prototype of the function. Unfortunately, this means that any class\nthat extends the patched class will have the same value for `name`.\n\nPR Close #41416",
