The following supporting classes were removed from `@angular/core`: <ul><li><code>NgModuleFactoryLoader</code></li><li><code>SystemJsNgModuleFactoryLoader</code></li></ul> The `@angular/router` package no longer exports the following symbols: <ul><li><code>SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader</code></li><li><code>DeprecatedLoadChildren</code></li></ul> The signature of the `setupTestingRouter` function from `@angular/core/testing` was changed to drop the `NgModuleFactoryLoader` parameter, since an value for that parameter can not be created.                                                        |\n-| [43496][GithubAngularAngularPull43496] | The router no longer replaces the browser URL when a new navigation cancels an ongoing navigation. The replacement of the browser URL often caused URL flicker and was only in place to support some AngularJS hybrid applications. Hybrid applications which rely on the presence of `navigationId` on each initial navigation handled by the Angular router should instead subscribe to `NavigationCancel` events and manually perform the `location.replaceState` to add `navigationId` to the Router state.<br />In addition, tests that assert `urlChanges` on the `SpyLocation` should be adjusted to account for the lack of the `replaceState` trigger.                          |\n-| [41730][GithubAngularAngularPull41730] | The behavior of the `SpyLocation` used by the `RouterTestingModule` has changed to match the behavior of browsers. It no longer emits a `popstate` event when `Location.go` is called. In addition, `simulateHashChange` now triggers *both* a `hashchange` event and a `popstate` event. Tests that use `location.go` and expect the changes to be picked up by the `Router` should migrate to `simulateHashChange`. Each test is different in what it attempts to assert, so there is no single change that works for all tests. Each test that uses the `SpyLocation` to simulate changes in the browser URL should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.                             |\n-| [43087][GithubAngularAngularPull43087] | Previously ,`null` and `undefined` inputs for `routerLink` were equivalent to empty string and there was no way to disable the navigation of the link. In addition, the `href` is changed from a property `HostBinding()` to an attribute binding \\(`HostBinding('attr.href')`\\). The effect of this change is that `DebugElement.properties['href']` now returns the `href` value returned by the native element which is the full URL rather than the internal value of the `RouterLink` `href` property.                                                                                                                                                                              |\n-| [31187][GithubAngularAngularPull31187] | Previously, the default url serializer dropped everything after and including a question mark in query parameters. That is, for a navigation to `/path?q=hello?&other=123`, the query parameters parsed to just `{q: 'hello'}`. This is incorrect, because the URI spec allows for question mark characers in query data.

Any breakage caused by this change is likely due to one of the following two problems: <ol><li>The app is comparing <code>AbstractControl.status</code> against a string which is not a valid status.</li><li>The app is using `statusChanges` events as if they were something other than strings.</li></ol> |\n+| [PR&nbsp;#43087][GithubAngularAngularPull43087] | Previously ,`null` and `undefined` inputs for `routerLink` were equivalent to empty string and there was no way to disable the navigation of the link. In addition, the `href` is changed from a property `HostBinding()` to an attribute binding \\(`HostBinding('attr.href')`\\). The effect of this change is that `DebugElement.properties['href']` now returns the `href` value returned by the native element which is the full URL rather than the internal value of the `RouterLink` `href` property.                                                                                                                                                                              |\n+| [PR&nbsp;#43496][GithubAngularAngularPull43496] | The router no longer replaces the browser URL when a new navigation cancels an ongoing navigation. The replacement of the browser URL often caused URL flicker and was only in place to support some AngularJS hybrid applications. Hybrid applications which rely on the presence of `navigationId` on each initial navigation handled by the Angular router should instead subscribe to `NavigationCancel` events and manually perform the `location.replaceState` to add `navigationId` to the Router state.<br />In addition, tests that assert `urlChanges` on the `SpyLocation` should be adjusted to account for the lack of the `replaceState` trigger.                          |\n+| [PR&nbsp;#43507][GithubAngularAngularPull43507] | The `WrappedValue` class is no longer imported from `@angular/core`. This change may result in compile errors or failures at runtime, if outdated libraries are used that rely on `WrappedValue`. Dependancy on `WrappedValue` should be removed since no replacement is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n+| [PR&nbsp;#43591][GithubAngularAngularPull43591] | It is no longer possible to use `Route.loadChildren` with a string value. The following supporting classes were removed from `@angular/core`: <ul><li><code>NgModuleFactoryLoader</code></li><li><code>SystemJsNgModuleFactoryLoader</code></li></ul> The `@angular/router` package no longer exports the following symbols: <ul><li><code>SpyNgModuleFactoryLoader</code></li><li><code>DeprecatedLoadChildren</code></li></ul> The signature of the `setupTestingRouter` function from `@angular/core/testing` was changed to drop the `NgModuleFactoryLoader` parameter, since an value for that parameter can not be created.                                                        |\n+| [PR&nbsp;#43642][GithubAngularAngularPull43642] | TypeScript versions older than `4.4.2` are no longer supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n+| [PR&nbsp;#43668][GithubAngularAngularPull43668] | The return type of `SwUpdate#activateUpdate` and `SwUpdate#checkForUpdate` changed to `Promise<boolean>`.<br />Although unlikely, this change may cause TypeScript type-checking to fail in some cases.
