    "message": "build: update karma-sauce-launcher to latest version with heartbeat to prevent idle timeout (#43659)\n\nUpdates the `karma-sauce-launcher` to the latest version that comes with\nthe heartbeat implemented. Whenever we create an instance of a browser\nin Saucelabs, we need to send a Selenium command every X seconds as otherwise\nSaucelabs will terminate the session due to it thinking the session is already\nunused. This is especially a problem for Karma unit tests as there is no\nselenium command at all, except for the initial one loading the Karma site.\n\nThe latest version of the launcher has implemented an interval that\ndispatches a noop selenium command every X seconds to notify Saucelabs\nthat the instance is still active.\n\nThe current version of the launcher does not do that. This is likely\nthe source of some disconnects because after 10-13min, the SL browser\nis terminated but Karma still waits some minute after realizing the\nbrowser is actually disconnected.\n\nWe (the Angular team), contributed to that version in the past since\nthe heartbeat was very flaky.. and we removed it. With the new version\na lot has changed, the underlying Selenium client has changed so it's\nworth trying again with the heartbeat re-implemented; it worked pretty\nwell so far in the COMP repo).\n\nPR Close #43659",
