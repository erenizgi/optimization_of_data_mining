    "message": "docs: use dedicated anchors for links to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (#41250)\n\nPreviously, some links to specific sections of `CONTRIBUTING.md` were\nusing hashes automatically generated by GitHub based on the section\nheadings. This resulted in less readable hashes which were directly tied\nto the heading text and thus less robust (i.e. more likely to break if\nthe heading was re-worded in the future).\n\nThis commit switches such links to use the dedicated anchors, which are\nmore succinct/readable and more stable.\n\nPR Close #41250",
