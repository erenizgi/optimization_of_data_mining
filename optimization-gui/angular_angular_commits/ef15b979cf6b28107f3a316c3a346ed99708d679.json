Those directives can add and remove copies of the template content based on their own logic.\n+\n+When using the [structural directive shorthand](/guide/structural-directives#structural-directive-shorthand), Angular creates an `<ng-template>` element behind the scenes.\n+\n+### TemplateRef\n+\n+`<ng-template>` elements are represented as instances of the `TemplateRef` class.\n+\n+To add copies of the template to the DOM, pass this object to the `ViewContainerRef` method `createEmbeddedView()`.\n+\n+### Template Variables\n+\n+`<ng-template>` elements can be referenced in templates using [standard template variables](/guide/template-reference-variables#how-angular-assigns-values-to-template-variables).\n+\n+_This is how `<ng-template>` elements are used as `ngIf` else clauses._\n+\n+Such template variables can be used in conjunction with `ngTemplateOutlet` directives to render the content defined inside `<ng-template>` tags.\n+\n+\n+### Querying\n+\n+A [Query](/api/core/Query) (such as `ViewChild`) can find the `TemplateRef` associated to an `<ng-template>` element so that it can be used programmatically; for instance, to pass it to the `ViewContainerRef` method `createEmbeddedView()`.\n+\n+\n+### Context\n+Inside the `<ng-template>` tags you can reference variables present in the surrounding outer template.\n+Additionally, a context object can be associated with `<ng-template>` elements.\n+Such an object contains variables that can be accessed from within the template contents via template (`let` and `as`) declarations.\n\\ No newline at end of file"
