    "message": "refactor(localize): ensure schematic code runs as commonjs (#44016)\n\nThe schematic code in `@angular/localize` is currently still emitted\nas CommonJS, while the rest of `@angular/localize` is strict ESM (which\nis also denoted through `type: module` in the package.json file).\n\nThe schematic code is currently imported as CJS from the CLI so it\nis not a problem right now. Still, it is safer to ensure the code\nfor schematics is properly picked up as CJS through a local\n`package.json` file resetting `type: module` to `type: commonjs`.\n\nPR Close #44016",
