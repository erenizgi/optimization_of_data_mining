    "message": "ci: exclude `service-worker/` sub-directories from `fw-testing` PullApprove group (#42631)\n\nThe `fw-testing` PullApprove group, which by default owns all `testing/`\nsub-directories, is supposed to own resources related to testing Angular\napplications (from an end-user's perspective). The `service-worker`\npackage source code includes some `testing/` sub-directories which are\nintended for internal use only (i.e. to test the `service-worker`\npackage itself) and are not distributed to end-users of the package.\n\nPreviously, changes in these `testing/` sub-directories would\nincorrectly require approval from the `fw-testing` group.\n\nThis commit fixes this by excluding the `service-worker` package\nsub-directories from the files owned by the `fw-testing` group.\n\nPR Close #42631",
