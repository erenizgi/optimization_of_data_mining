    "message": "fix(dev-infra): include `bazel` utility files in npm package (#37891)\n\nWe recently added a new folder for common bazel utilities\nto `dev-infra`. The `ng_rollup_bundle` rule relies on an\nutility that is provided by this `bazel/` folder.\n\nUnfortunately though it looks like this folder is currently\nnot included in the NPM package, so that the `ng_rollup_bundle`\nrule does not work as expected. This commit fixes that by\nincluding the bazel utilities in the NPM package.\n\nPR Close #37891",
