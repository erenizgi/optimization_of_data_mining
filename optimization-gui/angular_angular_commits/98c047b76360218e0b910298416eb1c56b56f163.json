    "message": "ci: decrease payload size limit for integration tests (#37784)\n\nThis commit updates the payload size limit for the `hello_world` test app built using Closure. This is likely an effect of the changes in https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36578 (that reduces the bundle size for most of the apps) and additional changes in subsequent commits.\n\nPR Close #37784",
