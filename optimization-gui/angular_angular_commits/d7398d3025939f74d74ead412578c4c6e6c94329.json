    "message": "fix(docs-infra): improve the layout of the \"Features\" page on medium screens (#41051)\n\nThe \"Features\" page organizes features in groups/rows of 3 features\neach. On wide screens, all 3 paragraphs of a group/row can be shown next\nto each other. On narrow screens (between 768px and 1057px), the layout\nchanges to stack the paragraphs vertically. On medium screens, however,\nthere is not enough space to show more than two paragraphs next to each\nother.\n\nPreviously, the 3rd paragraph was wrapped over to the next line.\n\nThis commit improves the layout on medium screens by switching to\nimmediately stacking the paragraphs vertically as soon as there is not\nenough space for them to be displayed in one row. Since the total width\nis still too much for one paragraph, the paragraphs are limited to 80%\nof the total width.\n\nBefore (on 1000px width): [features page (on 1000px) before][1]\nAfter (on 1000px width): [features page (on 1000px) after][2]\n\n[1]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8604205/109825316-62128a00-7c42-11eb-8391-650201257274.png\n[2]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8604205/109825323-6343b700-7c42-11eb-86c1-e8307c5a727a.png\n\nPR Close #41051",
