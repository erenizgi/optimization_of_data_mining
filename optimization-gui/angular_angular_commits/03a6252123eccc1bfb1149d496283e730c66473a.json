Navigation opens one or more routed components\n+ * in one or more `<router-outlet>` locations on the page.\n  *\n- * If the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:\n+ * Given a route configuration `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`,\n+ * the following creates a static link to the route:\n  * `<a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">link to user component</a>`\n  *\n- * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path\n- * segments, followed by the params for each segment.\n+ * You can use dynamic values to generate the link.\n+ * For a dynamic link, pass an array of path segments,\n+ * followed by the params for each segment.\n+ * For example, `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`\n+ * generates a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.\n+ *\n+ * Multiple static segments can be merged into one term and combined with dynamic segements.\n+ * For example, `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`\n+ *\n+ * The input that you provide to the link is treated as a delta to the current URL.\n+ * For instance, suppose the current URL is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.\n+ * The link `<a [routerLink]=\"['/user/jim']\">Jim</a>` creates the URL\n+ * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.\n+ * See {@link Router#createUrlTree createUrlTree} for more information.\n  *\n- * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`\n- * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.\n+ * @usageNotes\n  *\n- * Multiple static segments can be merged into one\n- * (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`).\n+ * You can use absolute or relative paths in a link, set query parameters,\n+ * control how parameters are handled, and keep a history of navigation states.\n  *\n- * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:\n- * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the\n+ * ### Relative link paths\n+ *\n+ * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`.\n+ * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router looks up the route from the root of the\n  *   app.\n- * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will\n- *   instead look in the children of the current activated route.\n- * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.\n+ * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router\n+ *   looks in the children of the current activated route.\n+ * * If the first segment begins with `../`, the router goes up one level in the route tree.\n+ *\n+ * ### Setting and handling query params and fragments\n  *\n- * You can set query params and fragment as follows:\n+ * The following link adds a query parameter and a fragment to the generated URL:\n  *\n  * ```\n  * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" fragment=\"education\">\n  *   link to user component\n  * </a>\n  * ```\n- * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob?debug=true#education`.\n+ * By default, the directive constructs the new URL using the given query parameters.\n+ * The example generates the link: `/user/bob?debug=true#education`.\n  *\n- * (Deprecated in v4.0.0 use `queryParamsHandling` instead) You can also tell the\n- * directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:\n+ * You can instruct the directive to handle query parameters differently\n+ * by specifying the `queryParamsHandling` option in the link.\n+ * Allowed values are:\n  *\n- * ```\n- * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>\n- *   link to user component\n- * </a>\n- * ```\n- *\n- * You can tell the directive how to handle queryParams.
