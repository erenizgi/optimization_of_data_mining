This seems to\nbecause with APF v13, the core package no longer uses the\ndownleveled `Object.assign`, but the spread operator directly.\n\nESbuild will then downlevel the spread to `__spreadProps` which\nseems to come with more transitively-required helpers that\nend up contributing to the ~400b increase. The spread is downleveled\neven for the modern browsers this integration test targets, because\nit is a trick to wrokaround a performance bug in V8. So the size\nincrease is reasonable given the runtime improvement. More details\nhere:\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/951#issuecomment-796972298.\n\nPR Close #43431",
