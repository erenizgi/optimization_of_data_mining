    "message": "build(docs-infra): add a link to `usage notes` from `description` (#40835)\n\nThe \"Usage Notes\" section is often at the bottom of a long page of content\nwhich can make it difficult to discover. This commit adds a link at the\nend of the \"Description\" if there is a \"Usage Notes\" section on the page.\nThis link should help the reader to discover that there is more information\navailable further down the page.\n\nThis is basically a marginal fix. The longer term fix should be to\nconsider what content goes in which sections and how they should\nbe laid out on the page.\n\nSee #40753\n\nPR Close #40835",
