    "message": "docs: fix instructions for setting up `ProductDetailsComponent` in `start-routing.md` (#40197)\n\nPR #34934 switched the `getting-started` docs example from using the\nindex of a product in the `products` array to using the product's ID\nproperty for indentifiying each product in the `ProductDetailsComponent`\ncomponent. However, some necessary changes in the example code and the\n`start-routing.md` guide were missed in #34934, resulting in broken\ninstructions for the readers (see #40189).\n\nThis commit is essentially a follow-up to #34934, making the remaining\nchanges in the example code and the guide instructions.\n\nFixes #40189\n\nPR Close #40197",
