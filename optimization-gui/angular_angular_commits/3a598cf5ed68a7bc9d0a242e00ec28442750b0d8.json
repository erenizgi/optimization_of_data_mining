This is because the tsconfig\nis part of the `packages` folder and not accessible from the\ndev-infra package. We fix this by adding an IDE and ts-node specific\ntsconfig to the dev-infra package.\n\nThis helps with spotting compilation failures before building\nwith Bazel / waiting for CI to check build state.\n\nPR Close #38656",
