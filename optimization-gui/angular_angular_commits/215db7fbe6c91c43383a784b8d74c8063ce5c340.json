    "message": "fix(core): error if NgZone.isInAngularZone is called with a noop zone (#44800)\n\nWhen the user opts into the noop `NgZone`, they usually still interact with the static methods on the non-noop class. This change adds a check to handle the case where zone.js hasn't been loaded.\n\nFixes #44784.\n\nPR Close #44800",
