Some reports are:\n* working as intended but confusing - the labels might be 'type: confusing', 'comp: docs', 'comp: router'\n* generally working as originally designed but a use-case could be argued for a different implementation.\n This type of report is a little hard to triage; it may be neither a bug, nor feature but more of a\n 'type: use-case'. These may eventually turn into a bug/fix or feature, but can't necessarily be\n put in those buckets immediately.\n\nPR Close #38081",
