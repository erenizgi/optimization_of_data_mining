    "message": "ci: remove *.bazel from dev-infra ownership (#41382)\n\nHistorically all .bazel files were owned by dev-infra to assist in ensuring that\nconsistency was maintained in how rules were being used.  As this now has reached\na point of maturity in the repository where the check is mostly a rubber stamping,\nthis requirement can be removed.  Notably this is different than the requirement\nof dev-infra approval for .bzl files as these contain the implementation of macros\nrather than just the usage.\n\nPR Close #41382",
