Angular created our own scheme using the syntax `loadChildren: './lazy/lazy.module#LazyModule'` and built tooling to support it. Now that ECMAScript dynamic import is supported in many browsers, Angular is moving toward this new syntax.\n \n In version 8, the string syntax for the [`loadChildren`](api/router/LoadChildren) route specification was deprecated, in favor of new syntax that uses `import()` syntax.\n \n-Before:\n+**Before**:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"typescript\">\n \n-```\n const routes: Routes = [{\n   path: 'lazy',\n   // The following string syntax for loadChildren is deprecated\n   loadChildren: './lazy/lazy.module#LazyModule'\n }];\n-```\n \n-After:\n+</code-example>\n+\n+**After**:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"typescript\">\n \n-```\n const routes: Routes = [{\n   path: 'lazy',\n   // The new import() syntax\n   loadChildren: () => import('./lazy/lazy.module').then(m => m.LazyModule)\n }];\n-```\n \n+</code-example>\n \n <div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n \n-\n **Version 8 update**: When you update to version 8, the [`ng update`](cli/update) command performs the transformation automatically.

Because the polyfill can be depended on by 3rd-party libraries, instead of removing it from all Angular projects, we are deprecating the requirement for this polyfill as of version 8.0. This should give library authors and application developers sufficient time to evaluate if they need the polyfill, and perform any refactoring necessary to remove the dependency on it.\n \n In a typical Angular project, the polyfill is not used in production builds, so removing it should not impact production applications. The goal behind this removal is overall simplification of the build setup and decrease in the number of external dependencies.\n \n {@a static-query-resolution}\n+\n ### `@ViewChild()` / `@ContentChild()` static resolution as the default\n \n See the [dedicated migration guide for static queries](guide/static-query-migration).\n \n {@a contentchild-input-together}\n+\n ### `@ContentChild()` / `@Input()` used together\n \n The following pattern is deprecated:\n \n-```ts\n-@Input() @ContentChild(TemplateRef) tpl !: TemplateRef<any>;\n-```\n+<code-example language=\"typescript\">\n+\n+@Input() @ContentChild(TemplateRef) tpl !: TemplateRef&lt;any&gt;;\n+\n+</code-example>\n \n Rather than using this pattern, separate the two decorators into their own\n properties and add fallback logic as in the following example:\n \n-```ts\n-@Input() tpl !: TemplateRef<any>;\n-@ContentChild(TemplateRef) inlineTemplate !: TemplateRef<any>;\n-```\n+<code-example language=\"typescript\">\n+\n+@Input() tpl !: TemplateRef&lt;any&gt;;\n+@ContentChild(TemplateRef) inlineTemplate !: TemplateRef&lt;any&gt;;\n+\n+</code-example>\n+\n {@a cant-assign-template-vars}\n+\n ### Cannot assign to template variables\n \n In the following example, the two-way binding means that `optionName`\n should be written when the `valueChange` event fires.\n \n-```html\n-<option *ngFor=\"let optionName of options\" [(value)]=\"optionName\"></option>\n-```\n+<code-example language=\"html\">\n+\n+&lt;option *ngFor=\"let optionName of options\" [(value)]=\"optionName\"&gt;&lt;/option&gt;\n+\n+</code-example>\n \n However, in practice, Angular ignores two-way bindings to template variables.

For this reason, we are deprecating this behavior. Going forward, users should explicitly bind to `textContent` when using Domino.\n \n {@a wtf-apis}\n+\n ### `wtfStartTimeRange` and all `wtf*` APIs\n \n All of the `wtf*` APIs are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n \n {@a entryComponents}\n+\n ### `entryComponents` and `ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS` no longer required\n+\n Previously, the `entryComponents` array in the `NgModule` definition was used to tell the compiler which components would be created and inserted dynamically.\n With Ivy, this isn't a requirement anymore and the `entryComponents` array can be removed from existing module declarations.\n The same applies to the `ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS` injection token.\n \n-Note: You may still need to keep these if building a library that will be consumed by a View Engine application.\n+**NOTE**: You may still need to keep these if building a library that will be consumed by a View Engine application.\n \n {@a moduleWithProviders}\n+\n ### `ModuleWithProviders` type without a generic\n \n Some Angular libraries, such as `@angular/router` and `@ngrx/store`, implement APIs that return a type called `ModuleWithProviders` (typically using a method named `forRoot()`).\n This type represents an `NgModule` along with additional providers.\n Angular version 9 deprecates use of `ModuleWithProviders` without an explicitly generic type, where the generic type refers to the type of the `NgModule`.\n In a future version of Angular, the generic will no longer be optional.\n \n-\n If you're using the CLI, `ng update` should [migrate your code automatically](guide/migration-module-with-providers).\n If you're not using the CLI, you can add any missing generic types to your application manually.\n For example:\n \n **Before**\n-```ts\n+\n+<code-example language=\"typescript\">\n+\n @NgModule({...})\n export class MyModule {\n   static forRoot(config: SomeConfig): ModuleWithProviders {\n@@ -412,11 +428,13 @@ export class MyModule {\n     };\n   }\n }\n-```\n \n-**After**\n+</code-example>\n+\n+**After**:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"typescript\">\n \n-```ts\n @NgModule({...})\n export class MyModule {\n   static forRoot(config: SomeConfig): ModuleWithProviders<SomeModule> {\n@@ -428,10 +446,12 @@ export class MyModule {\n     };\n   }\n }\n-```\n+\n+</code-example>\n \n {@a wrapped-value}\n-###  `WrappedValue`\n+\n+### `WrappedValue`\n \n The purpose of `WrappedValue` is to allow the same object instance to be treated as different for the purposes of change detection.\n It is commonly used with the `async` pipe in the case where the `Observable` produces the same instance of the value.\n@@ -440,23 +460,36 @@ Given that this use case is relatively rare and special handling impacts applica\n No replacement is planned for this deprecation.\n \n If you rely on the behavior that the same object instance should cause change detection, you have two options:\n-- Clone the resulting value so that it has a new identity.\n-- Explicitly call [`ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`](api/core/ChangeDetectorRef#detectchanges) to force the update.\n+\n+*   Clone the resulting value so that it has a new identity.\n+*   Explicitly call [`ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`](api/core/ChangeDetectorRef#detectchanges) to force the update.\n+\n+<!--\n+### Internet Explorer 11\n+\n+Angular support for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) is deprecated and will be removed in Angular v13.\n+Ending IE11 support allows Angular to take advantage of web platform APIs present only in evergreen browsers, resulting in better APIs for developers and more capabilities for application users.\n+An additional motivation behind this removal is the drop in global usage of IE11 to just ~1% (as of March 2021).\n+For full rationale and discussion behind this deprecation, see [RFC: Internet Explorer 11 support deprecation and removal](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41840).\n+\n+***Note***: *IE11 will be supported in Angular v12 LTS releases through November 2022.*\n+-->\n \n {@a deprecated-cli-flags}\n+\n ##

By default, the `ng build` command uses the `production` configuration, which applies a number of build optimizations, including:\n-* Bundling files\n-* Minimizing excess whitespace\n-* Removing comments and dead code\n-* Rewriting code to use short, mangled names (minification)\n \n-You can define and name additional alternate configurations (such as `stage`, for instance) appropriate to your development process. Some examples of different build configurations are `stable`, `archive` and `next` used by AIO itself, and the individual locale-specific configurations required for building localized versions of an application.
