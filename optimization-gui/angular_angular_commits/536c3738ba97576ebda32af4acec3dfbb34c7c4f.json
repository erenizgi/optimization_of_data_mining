    "message": "docs: clarify onSameUrlNavigation behavior (#42275)\n\n`onSameUrlNavigation` only affects whether the Angular Router\nprocesses the URL and runs it through the navigation pipeline,\nretriggering redirects, guards, and resolvers. The name `reload` is a\nlittle confusing because it does _not_ reload the component. Developers\n_also_ need to implement a custom `RouteReuseStrategy` to trigger a\ncomponent reload on same URL navigation.\n\nFixes #21115\n\nPR Close #42275",
