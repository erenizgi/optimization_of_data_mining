    "message": "docs: fix link to commit in `CHANGELOG.md` (#39704)\n\nCurrently, the script that is used to generate the `CHANGELOG.md`\ncontent uses the first 7 characters of a commit SHA in the generated\nlinks. This is problematic when there are multiple commits in the repo\n(or forks of the repo?) that start with the same 7 characters (which is\nrare but possible), since GitHub shows a 404 page.\n\nThis was the case with commit 736e0644b02bc4606a7ae0c974d1b06e993708f6\nthat is included in the v11.0.0 release notes and happens to start with\nthe same characters as commit 736e064ac80f5e0ed84711694c2ba68809222ffd.\n\nThis commit fixes the issue by using the full commit SHA in the link for\nthis particular commit.\n\nNOTE:\nThe underlying issue should be more generically addressed in the\nchangelog generation tooling. This is being tracked in #39698.\n\nPR Close #39704",
