    "message": "docs: add `enableI18nLegacyMessageIdFormat` option to Angular compiler options guide (#39453)\n\nThe ViewEngine message extraction generated a variety of legacy formats\nfor extracted message ids. These formats have a number of issues related\nto whitespace handling and reliance upon information inside the original\nHTML of a template. The new message format is more resilient, and can be\ngenerated directly from calls to `$localize`. This allows messages in\napplication code to have the same id as identical messages in templates.\n\nAs a first step in migrating projects away from the legacy id format\nfor i18n messages, newly generated projects now turn off the legacy ids.\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/19232.\n\nThis commit updates the documentation to include information about this\noption, since it is now publicly exposed in new CLI projects.\n\nPR Close #39453",
