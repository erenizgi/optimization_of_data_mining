This can happen because Ivy's stricter checking catches genuine errors, or because application code is not typed correctly, or because the application uses libraries in which typings are inaccurate or not specific enough.\n \n This stricter type checking is not enabled by default in version 9, but can be enabled by setting the `strictTemplates` configuration option.\n-We do expect to make strict type checking the default in the future.\n \n For more information about type-checking options, and about improvements to template type checking in version 9 and above, see [Template type checking](guide/template-typecheck).\n "
