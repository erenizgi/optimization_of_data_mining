At the same time, our list of projects contains plenty of maintenance tasks, code refactorings, and potential performance improvements. We bring together representatives from developer relations, product management, and engineering to prioritize this list. As new projects come into the queue, we regularly position them based on relative priority to other projects. As work gets done, projects move up in the queue.\n "
