    "message": "fix(docs-infra): prevent main content from overlapping with ToC (#42884)\n\nPreviously, if there was more content than what would horizontally fit\nin the main content area, it would overflow to the right and overlap\nwith the Table of Contents (ToC).\nThis was accidentally introduced in #42787.\n\nThis commit fixes it by ensuring that the main content area will not\noverlap with ToC and the necessary space for the ToC will be reserved\nusing `margin` (instead of `padding`, which contributes to the element's\nsize).\n\nFixes #42867\n\nPR Close #42884",
