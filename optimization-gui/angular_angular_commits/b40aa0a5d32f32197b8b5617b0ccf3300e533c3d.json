A button's `disabled`\n-*property* is `false` by default so the button is enabled.\n-\n-When you add the `disabled` *attribute*, its presence alone\n-initializes the button's `disabled` *property* to `true`\n-so the button is disabled.\n-\n-```html\n-<button disabled>Test Button</button>\n-```\n-\n-Adding and removing the `disabled` *attribute* disables and enables the button.\n-However, the value of the *attribute* is irrelevant,\n-which is why you cannot enable a button by writing `<button disabled=\"false\">Still Disabled</button>`.\n-\n-To control the state of the button, set the `disabled` *property*,\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-Though you could technically set the `[attr.disabled]` attribute binding, the values are different in that the property binding requires to be a boolean value, while its corresponding attribute binding relies on whether the value is `null` or not.
