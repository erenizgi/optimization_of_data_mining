    "message": "refactor(localize): avoid computing source-maps in extraction unnecessarily (#40891)\n\nPreviously we were calling `updateSourceLocations()` as part of\n`extractMessages()` for every file that was passed in, regardless of\nwhether any `$localize` tagged strings were to be found in the file.\n\nThis was very wasteful because it is non-trivial to compute the flattened\nsource-map for files if it is not needed.\n\nPR Close #40891",
