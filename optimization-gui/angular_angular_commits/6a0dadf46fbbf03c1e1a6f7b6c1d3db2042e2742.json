    "message": "fix(forms): `_reduceValue` arrow function now has correct types. (#44483)\n\nI previously strengthened some weak types in #44370. One of these fixes exposed an incorrect call into `_reduceChildren` from `_reduceValue`. This was caught in google3 by a caller who was extending `FormGroup` and overriding these methods.\n\nSpecial thanks to Bart G for catching this issue and suggesting a fix.\n\nPR Close #44483",
