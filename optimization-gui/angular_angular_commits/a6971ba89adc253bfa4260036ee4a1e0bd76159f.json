This behavior used to hide real errors,\n+so the logic is now updated to trigger original errors (if any). One exception\n+where the patch remains in place is `document.registerElement`\n+(to allow smooth transition for code/polyfills that rely on old behavior in legacy browsers).\n+If your code relies on the old behavior (where errors were not thrown before),\n+you may need to update the logic to handle the errors that are no longer masked by ZoneJS patch.\n+\n+\n+\n <a name=\"0.11.1\"></a>\n ## [0.11.1](https://github.com/angular/angular/compare/zone.js-0.11.0...zone.js-0.11.1) (2020-08-19)\n \n@@ -11,7 +40,7 @@\n \n Prior to `v0.11.1`, Zone.js provided two distribution bundle formats in the `dist` folder.\n They were (1) `ES5` bundle distributed as `zone.js` and (2) `ES2015` bundle distributed as `zone-evergreen.js`.\n-These bundles are used for Angular's differential-loading mechanism. \n+These bundles are used for Angular's differential-loading mechanism.\n \n Prior to `v0.11.11` the following code\n "
