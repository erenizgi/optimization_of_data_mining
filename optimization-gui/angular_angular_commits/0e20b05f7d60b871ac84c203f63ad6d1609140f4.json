At the same time, our list of projects contains plenty of maintenance tasks, code refactorings, and potential performance improvements. We bring together representatives from developer relations, product management, and engineering to prioritize this list. As new projects come into the queue, we regularly position them based on relative priority to other projects. As work gets done, projects will move up in the queue.\n \n The projects below are not associated with a particular Angular version. We'll release them on completion, and they will be part of a specific version based on our release schedule, following semantic versioning. For example, features are released in the next minor after they are complete, or the next major if they include breaking changes."
