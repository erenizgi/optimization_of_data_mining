Grouping of these files is essential for integrity because HTML, JS, and CSS files frequently refer to each other and depend on specific content. For example, an `index.html` file might have a `<script>` tag that references `bundle.js` and it might attempt to call a function `startApp()` from within that script. Any time this version of `index.html` is served, the corresponding `bundle.js` must be served with it. For example, assume that the `startApp()` function is renamed to `runApp()` in both files. In this scenario, it is not valid to serve the old `index.html`, which calls `startApp()`, along with the new bundle, which defines `runApp()`.\n+To preserve application integrity, the Angular service worker groups all files into a version together.
