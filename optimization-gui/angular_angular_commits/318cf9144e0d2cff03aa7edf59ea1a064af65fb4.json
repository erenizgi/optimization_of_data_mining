    "message": "test(core): fix failing unit test (#43714)\n\nFixes a unit test that now fails, because rethrowing errors is enabled by default. The problem is that we're checking the behavior of a component that throws during `ngOnDestroy`, but since the `resetTestingModule` call itself throws, the test is considered as failing.\n\nPR Close #43714",
