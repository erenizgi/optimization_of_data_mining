    "message": "refactor: setup bazel integration test with new integration rule (#44238)\n\nSets up the Bazel integration test with the new integration rule. This\ncommit is separate from the other changes because it required some\nadditional work. i.e.\n\nThe test has moved from `integration/bazel` to `integration/<..>/bazel`\nwhere `<..>` is a new Bazel package defining the integration test.\n\nThis is necessary because we could not declare the integration test\nwithin the `BUILD.bazel` file actually being part of the nested bazel\nworkspace. In those cases we can just define it at a higher-level and\nuse integration test `working_dir` attribute.\n\nPR Close #44238",
