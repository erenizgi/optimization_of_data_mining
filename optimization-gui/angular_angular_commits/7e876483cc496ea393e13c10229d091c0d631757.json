As such is should have been\nmarked with a different scope (for example, `ci`/`build`/`refactoring`)\nand should not appear in `CHANGELOG.md`.\n\nThis commit removes the entry from `CHANGELOG.md` to avoid confusing\ndevelopers trying to understand how this change may affect their apps.\n\nNOTE:\nThe commit contains a breaking change notice (about dropping support for\nIE<11) which _is_ relevant to app developers. This breaking change\nnotice is preserved in the \"BREAKING CHANGES\" section, but the scope is\nchanges from `packaging` to `core` to avoid confusion.\n\nPR Close #39704",
