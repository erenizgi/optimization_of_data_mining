It is not needed for this example.\n-\n-Then modify the <code>app.component.ts</code> file by\n-changing the template and the body of the component.\n-\n-When you're done, it should look like this:\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.1.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts\"></code-example>\n-\n-You added two properties to the formerly empty component: `title` and `myHero`.\n-\n-The template displays the two component properties using double curly brace\n-interpolation:\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.1.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts (template)\" region=\"template\"></code-example>\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-The template is a multi-line string within ECMAScript 2015 backticks (<code>\\`</code>).\n-The backtick (<code>\\`</code>)&mdash;which is *not* the same character as a single\n-quote (`'`)&mdash;allows you to compose a string over several lines, which makes the\n-HTML more readable.\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-Angular automatically pulls the value of the `title` and `myHero` properties from the component and\n-inserts those values into the browser. Angular updates the display\n-when these properties change.\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-More precisely, the redisplay occurs after some kind of asynchronous event related to\n-the view, such as a keystroke, a timer completion, or a response to an HTTP request.\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-Notice that you don't call **new** to create an instance of the `AppComponent` class.\n-Angular is creating an instance for you. How?\n-\n-The CSS `selector` in the `@Component` decorator specifies an element named `<app-root>`.\n-That element is a placeholder in the body of your `index.html` file:\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/index.html\" header=\"src/index.html (body)\" region=\"body\"></code-example>\n-\n-When you bootstrap with the `AppComponent` class (in <code>main.ts</code>), Angular looks for a `<app-root>`\n-in the `index.html`, finds it, instantiates an instance of `AppComponent`, and renders it\n-inside the `<app-root>` tag.\n-\n-Now run the app. It should display the title and hero name:\n-\n-<div class=\"lightbox\">\n-  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/displaying-data/title-and-hero.png\" alt=\"Title and Hero\">\n-</div>\n-\n-The next few sections review some of the coding choices in the app.\n-\n-\n-## Choosing the template source\n-\n-The `@Component` metadata tells Angular where to find the component's template.\n-You can store your component's template in one of two places.\n-\n-* You can define the template *inline* using the `template` property of the `@Component` decorator. An inline template is useful for a small demo or test.\n-* Alternatively, you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to that file in the `templateUrl` property of the `@Component` decorator. This configuration is typical for anything more complex than a small test or demo, and is the default when you generate a new component.\n-\n-In either style, the template data bindings have the same access to the component's properties.\n-Here the app uses inline HTML because the template is small and the demo is simpler without the additional HTML file.\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-  By default, the Angular CLI command [`ng generate component`](cli/generate) generates components with a template file.\n-  You can override that by adding the \"-t\" (short for `inlineTemplate=true`) option:\n-\n-  <code-example hideCopy language=\"sh\" class=\"code-shell\">\n-    ng generate component hero -t\n-  </code-example>\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-## Initialization\n-\n-The following example uses variable assignment to initialize the components.\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app-ctor.component.1.ts\" region=\"class\"></code-example>\n-\n- You could instead declare and initialize the properties using a constructor.\n- This app uses more terse \"variable assignment\" style simply for brevity.\n-\n-\n-{@a ngFor}\n-\n-## Add logic to loop through data\n-\n-The `*ngFor` directive (predefined by Angular) lets you loop through data. The following example uses the directive to show all of the values in an array property.\n-\n-To display a list of heroes, begin by adding an array of hero names to the component and redefine `myHero` to be the first name in the array.\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.2.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts (class)\" region=\"class\"></code-example>\n-\n-\n-Now use the Angular `ngFor` directive in the template to display each item in the `heroes` list.\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.2.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts (template)\" region=\"template\"></code-example>\n-\n-\n-This UI uses the HTML unordered list with `<ul>` and `<li>` tags. The `*ngFor`\n-in the `<li>` element is the Angular \"repeater\" directive.\n-It marks that `<li>` element (and its children) as the \"repeater template\":\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.2.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts (li)\" region=\"li\"></code-example>\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-important\">\n-\n-Don't forget the leading asterisk (\\*) in `*ngFor`.

Read\n-more about template input variables in the [microsyntax](guide/built-in-directives#microsyntax) section of\n-the [Built-in directives](guide/built-in-directives) page.\n-\n-Angular duplicates the `<li>` for each item in the list, setting the `hero` variable\n-to the item (the hero) in the current iteration. Angular uses that variable as the\n-context for the interpolation in the double curly braces.\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-In this case, `ngFor` is displaying an array, but `ngFor` can\n-repeat items for any [iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) object.\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-Now the heroes appear in an unordered list.\n-\n-<div class=\"lightbox\">\n-  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/displaying-data/hero-names-list.png\" alt=\"After ngfor\">\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-## Creating a class for the data\n-\n-The app's code defines the data directly inside the component, which isn't best practice.\n-In a simple demo, however, it's fine.\n-\n-At the moment, the binding is to an array of strings.\n-In real applications, most bindings are to more specialized objects.\n-\n-To convert this binding to use specialized objects, turn the array\n-of hero names into an array of `Hero` objects. For that you'll need a `Hero` class:\n-\n-<code-example language=\"sh\" class=\"code-shell\">\n-  ng generate class hero\n-</code-example>\n-\n-This command creates the following code.\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/hero.ts\" header=\"src/app/hero.ts\"></code-example>\n-\n-You've defined a class with a constructor and two properties: `id` and `name`.\n-\n-It might not look like the class has properties, but it does.\n-The declaration of the constructor parameters takes advantage of a TypeScript shortcut.\n-\n-Consider the first parameter:\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/hero.ts\" header=\"src/app/hero.ts (id)\" region=\"id\"></code-example>\n-\n-That brief syntax does a lot:\n-\n-* Declares a constructor parameter and its type.\n-* Declares a public property of the same name.\n-* Initializes that property with the corresponding argument when creating an instance of the class.\n-\n-\n-### Using the Hero class\n-\n-After importing the `Hero` class, the `AppComponent.heroes` property can return a _typed_ array\n-of `Hero` objects:\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.3.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts (heroes)\" region=\"heroes\"></code-example>\n-\n-\n-\n-Next, update the template.\n-At the moment it displays the hero's `id` and `name`.\n-Fix that to display only the hero's `name` property.\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.3.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts (template)\" region=\"template\"></code-example>\n-\n-\n-The display looks the same, but the code is clearer.\n-\n-{@a ngIf}\n-\n-## Conditional display with NgIf\n-\n-Sometimes an app needs to display a view or a portion of a view only under specific circumstances.\n-\n-Let's change the example to display a message if there are more than three heroes.\n-\n-The Angular `ngIf` directive inserts or removes an element based on a _truthy/falsy_ condition.\n-To see it in action, add the following paragraph at the bottom of the template:\n-\n-\n-<code-example path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts (message)\" region=\"message\"></code-example>\n-\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-important\">\n-\n-Don't forget the leading asterisk (\\*) in `*ngIf`. It is an essential part of the syntax.\n-Read more about `ngIf` and `*` in the [ngIf section](guide/built-in-directives#ngIf) of the [Built-in directives](guide/built-in-directives) page.\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-The template expression inside the double quotes,\n-`*ngIf=\"heroes.length > 3\"`, looks and behaves much like TypeScript.\n-When the component's list of heroes has more than three items, Angular adds the paragraph\n-to the DOM and the message appears.\n-If there are three or fewer items, Angular omits the paragraph, so no message appears.\n-\n-For more information, see [template expression operators](guide/interpolation#template-expressions).\n-\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-Angular isn't showing and hiding the message. It is adding and removing the paragraph element from the DOM. That improves performance, especially in larger projects when conditionally including or excluding\n-big chunks of HTML with many data bindings.\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-Try it out. Because the array has four items, the message should appear.\n-Go back into <code>app.component.ts</code> and delete or comment out one of the elements from the heroes array.\n-The browser should refresh automatically and the message should disappear.\n-\n-\n-## Summary\n-Now you know how to use:\n-\n-* **Interpolation** with double curly braces to display a component property.\n-* **ngFor** to display an array of items.\n-* A TypeScript class to shape the **model data** for your component and display properties of that model.\n-* **ngIf** to conditionally display a chunk of HTML based on a boolean expression.\n-\n-Here's the final code:\n-\n-<code-tabs>\n-\n-  <code-pane header=\"src/app/app.component.ts\" path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.component.ts\" region=\"final\">\n-\n-  </code-pane>\n-\n-  <code-pane header=\"src/app/hero.ts\" path=\"displaying-data/src/app/hero.ts\">\n-\n-  </code-pane>\n-\n-  <code-pane header=\"src/app/app.module.ts\" path=\"displaying-data/src/app/app.module.ts\">\n-\n-  </code-pane>\n-\n-  <code-pane header=\"main.ts\" path=\"displaying-data/src/main.ts\">\n-\n-  </code-pane>\n-\n-</code-tabs>"
