    "message": "build: wire up new CLDR generation tool within Bazel (#42230)\n\nIntroduces a few Starlark macros for running the new Bazel\nCLDR generation tool. Wires up the new tool so that locales\nare generated properly. Also updates the existing\n`closure-locale` file to match the new output generated by the Bazel tool.\n\nThis commit also re-adds a few locale files that aren't\ngenerated by CLDR 37, but have been accidentally left in\nthe repository as the Gulp script never removed old locales\nfrom previous CLDR versions. This problem is solved with the\nBazel generation of locale files, but for now we re-add these\nold CLDR 33 locale files to not break developers relying on these\n(even though the locale data indicies are incorrect; but there might\nbe users accessing the data directly)\n\nPR Close #42230",
