Instead, applications must use the [`sass` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass), or the [`sass-embedded` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-embedded) for the `sass-embedded` beta.\n-* The Angular tooling now uses Webpack 5 to build applications. Webpack 4 usage and support has been removed.\n-  You don't need to make any project level configuration changes to use the upgraded Webpack version when using the official Angular builders.\n-  Custom builders based on this package that use the experimental programmatic APIs may need to be updated to become compatible with Webpack 5.\n-  See [PR #20466](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466).\n-* Webpack 5 generates similar but differently named files for lazy-loaded JavaScript files in development configurations when the `namedChunks` option is enabled.\n-  For the majority of users this change should have no effect on the application or build process.\n-  Production builds should also not be affected as the `namedChunks` option is disabled by default in production configurations.\n-  However, if a project's post-build process makes assumptions as to the file names, then adjustments may need to be made to account for the new naming paradigm.\n-  Such post-build processes could include custom file transformations after the build, integration into service-side frameworks, or deployment procedures.\n-  An example of a development file name change is `lazy-lazy-module.js` becoming `src_app_lazy_lazy_module_ts.js`.\n-  See [PR #20466](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466).\n-* Webpack 5 now includes web worker support.\n-  However, the structure of the URL within the worker constructor must be in a specific format that differs from the current requirement.\n-  To update web worker usage, where `./app.worker` is the actual worker name, change `new Worker('./app.worker', ...)` to `new Worker(new URL('./app.worker', import.meta.url), ...)`.\n-  See [PR #20466](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466).\n-* Critical CSS inlining is now enabled by default.\n-  To turn this off, set `inlineCritical` to false.\n-  See [PR #20096](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20096) and the [Style preprocessor options](guide/workspace-config#optimization-configuration) section of [Angular workspace configuration](guide/workspace-config).\n-* `ng build` now produces production bundle by default.\n-  See [PR #20128](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20128).\n-* Previously, the Forms module ignored `min` and `max` attributes defined on the `<input type=\"number\">`.\n-  Now these attributes trigger `min` and `max` validation logic in cases where `formControl`, `formControlName`, or `ngModel` directives are also present on a given input.\n-  See [PR #39063](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39063).\n-\n-\n-{@a deprecations}\n-### New deprecations\n-\n-* Support for Internet Explorer 11 is deprecated.\n-  See [Deprecated APIs and features](guide/deprecations) and [Microsoft 365 apps say farewell to Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 sunsets Microsoft Edge Legacy](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666).\n-* Sass imports from `@angular/material/theming` are deprecated. There is a new Angular Material Sass API for `@use`.\n-  Run the migration script `ng g @angular/material:themingApi` to switch all your Sass imports for Angular CDK and Angular Material to the new API and `@use`.\n-* Support for publishing libraries with View Engine has been deprecated:\n-  - You can now compile libraries in [_partial_ compilation mode](guide/angular-compiler-options#compilationmode) to generate Ivy compatible output that will be _linked_ when an application using that library is bundled.\n-  - New libraries you create with the Angular CLI default to partial compilation mode, and do not support View Engine. You can still build a library with View Engine. See [Creating libraries](guide/creating-libraries) for more information.\n-  - Libraries compiled in partial compilation mode will not contain legacy `i18n` message IDs.\n-    If the library was previously compiled by View Engine, and contained legacy `i18n` message IDs, then applications may have translation files that you'll need to migrate to the new message ID format. For more information, see [Migrating legacy localization IDs](guide/migration-legacy-message-id).\n-  - For context, see [Issue #38366](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38366)."
