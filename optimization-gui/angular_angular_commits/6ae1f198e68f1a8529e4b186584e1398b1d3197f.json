In v11, Angular framework removes IE 9,\n+10, and IE mobile support completely.\n+Supporting outdated browsers like these increases bundle size, code complexity, and test load,\n+and also requires time and effort that could be spent on improvements to the framework.\n+For example, fixing issues can be more difficult, as a straightforward fix for modern browsers\n+could break old ones that have quirks due to not receiving updates from vendors.\n+* **platform-webworker:** @angular/platform-webworker and @angular/platform-webworker-dynamic\n+have been removed as they were deprecated in v8\n+* **common:** The `slice` pipe now returns `null` for the `undefined` input value,\n+which is consistent with the behavior of most pipes. If you rely on\n+`undefined` being the result in that case, you now need to check for it\n+explicitly.\n+* **common:** The typing of the `keyvalue` pipe has been fixed to report that for\n+input objects that have `number` keys, the result will contain the\n+string representation of the keys. This was already the case and the\n+code has simply been updated to reflect this. Please update the\n+consumers of the pipe output if they were relying on the incorrect\n+types. Note that this does not affect use cases where the input values\n+are `Map`s, so if you need to preserve `number`s, this is an effective\n+way.\n+* **common:** The signatures of the number pipes now explicitly state which types are\n+accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n+values would result in runtime exceptions.\n+* **common:** The signature of the `date` pipe now explicitly states which types are\n+accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n+values would result in runtime exceptions.\n+* **common:** The async pipe no longer claims to return `undefined` for an input that\n+was typed as `undefined`. Note that the code actually returned `null` on\n+`undefined` inputs. In the unlikely case you were relying on this,\n+please fix the typing of the consumers of the pipe output.\n+* **common:** The case conversion pipes no longer let falsy values through. They now\n+map both `null` and `undefined` to `null` and raise an exception on\n+invalid input (`0`, `false`, `NaN`) just like most \"common pipes\". If\n+your code required falsy values to pass through, you need to handle them\n+explicitly.\n+* **router:** While the new parameter types allow a variable of type\n+`NavigationExtras` to be passed in, they will not allow object literals,\n+as they may only specify known properties. They will also not accept\n+types that do not have properties in common with the ones in the `Pick`.\n+To fix this error, only specify properties from the `NavigationExtras` which are\n+actually used in the respective function calls or use a type assertion\n+on the object or variable: `as NavigationExtras`.\n+* **router:** This commit changes the default value of\n+`relativeLinkResolution` from `'legacy'` to `'default'`. If your\n+application previously used the default by not specifying a value in the\n+`ExtraOptions` and uses relative links when navigating from children of\n+empty path routes, you will need to update your `RouterModule` to\n+specifically specify `'legacy'` for `relativeLinkResolution`.\n+See https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions#relativeLinkResolution\n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+\n <a name=\"10.1.4\"></a>\n ## 10.1.4 (2020-09-30)\n "
