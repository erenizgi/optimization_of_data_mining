Users with more complicated setups may need to manually configure the `APP_BASE_HREF` token within the application. (e.g., application routing base is / but assets/scripts/etc. are at /assets/).\n+\n+Unlike the `base href` which can be defined in a single place, the `deploy url` needs to be hard-coded into an application at build time. This means specifying a `deploy url` will decrease build speed, but this is the unfortunate cost of using an option that embeds itself throughout an application. That is why a `base href` is generally the better option.\n+\n {@a differential-loading}\n \n ## Differential Loading"
