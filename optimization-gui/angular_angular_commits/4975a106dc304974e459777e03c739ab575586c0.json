Prerendering is the process where a dynamic page is processed at build time generating static HTML.\n+\n+## How to prerender a page\n+\n+To prerender a static page make sure to add SSR capabilities to your application.\n+For more information see the [universal guide](guide/universal).\n+Once SSR is added, run the following command:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"sh\">\n+npm run prerender\n+</code-example>\n+\n+### Build options for prerendering\n+\n+When you add prerendering to your application, the following build options are available:\n+\n+* `browserTarget`: Specify the target to build.\n+* `serverTarget`: Specify the Server target to use for prerendering the application.\n+* `routes`: Define an array of additional routes to prerender.\n+* `guessRoutes`: Whether builder should extract routes and guess which paths to render. Defaults to `true`.\n+* `routesFile`: Specify a file that contains a list of all routes to prerender, separated by newlines. This option is useful if you have a large number of routes.\n+* `numProcesses`: Specify the number of CPUs to be used while running the prerendering command.\n+\n+### Prerendering dynamic routes\n+\n+You can prerender dynamic routes. An example of a dynamic route is `product/:id`, where `id` is dynamically provided.\n+\n+To prerender dynamic routes, choose one from the following options:\n+ * Provide additional routes in the command line\n+ * Provide routes using a file\n+ * Prerender specific routes \n+\n+#### Provide additional routes in the command line\n+\n+While running the prerender command, you can provide additional routes. For example:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"sh\">\n+ng run &lt;app-name&gt;:prerender --routes /product/1 /product/2\n+</code-example>\n+\n+\n+#### Providing additonal routes using a file\n+\n+You can provide routes using a file to generate static pages. This method is useful if you have a large number of routes to generate, such as product details for an e-commerce application, which may come from an external source (Database or CMS).\n+\n+To provide routes using a file, use the `--routes-file` option with the name of a `.txt` file containing the routes.\n+\n+For example, you could generate this file by using a script to extract IDs from a database and save them to a `routes.txt` file:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"none\" header=\"routes.txt\">\n+  /products/1\n+  /products/555\n+</code-example>\n+\n+When your `.txt` file is ready, run the following command to prerender the static files with dynamic values:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"sh\">\n+ng run &lt;app-name&gt;:prerender --routes-file routes.txt\n+</code-example>\n+\n+#### Prerendering specific routes\n+\n+You can also pass specific routes to the prerender command. If you choose this option, make sure to disable the `guessRoutes` option.\n+\n+<code-example language=\"sh\">\n+ng run &lt;app-name&gt;:prerender --no-guess-routes --routes /product/1 /product/1 \n+</code-example>\n\\ No newline at end of file"
