    "message": "docs: update Node.js supported version statement (#41820)\n\nUpdate the statement expressing Angular's supported versions of Node.js. Previously, we stated\nthat the `current` version of Node.js was supported, however Node.js's `current` version maps\nmore closely to what we would term a `next` branch and is not expected meant for usage with\nproduction applications. This intention is stated on Node.js Releases page:\n\n> Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases.\n\nPR Close #41820",
