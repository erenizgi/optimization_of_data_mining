    "message": "fix(docs-infra): use a fixed top-menu on marketing pages as well (#41051)\n\nPreviously, in contrast to docs pages, marketing pages had a non-fixed\ntop-menu, which meant that the top-menu would scroll out of the viewport\nalong with the rest of the content. This had a couple of downsides:\n- The UI was different between pages (i.e. different top-menu behavior\n  on docs vs marketing pages).\n- Since some of the marketing pages are long, it was not easy for people\n  to navigate to a different page (i.e. they had to scroll all the way\n  back up).\n\nThis commit improves the UX by using the same, fixed top-menu on all\npages, which restores consistency and allows the user to navigate around\nmore easily.\n\nNOTE:\nThe old behavior (non-fixed top-menu) is kept on the homepage, since its\ntop-menu design in a little different than other pages (e.g. it uses a\ntransparent top-menu) and would not play well with a fixed top-menu.\n\nPR Close #41051",
