    "message": "build: enable code splitting for esbuild bundling of localize tools (#43932)\n\nEnables code spitting for ESBuild bundling of the localize/tools entry\npoint. When we initially configured ESBuild as part of APF v13, we left\nthis option disabled as code splitting is marked experimental. The ESM\nsplitting mechanism in ESBuild seems very solid so far (judging subjectively\nand by experience/reports in the ESBuild repo), so we should give it a shot,\nin order to significantly reduce the size of the NPM package, and simplify\ndebugging (by not having duplicated code portions for all the different entry points).\n\nTo clarify: Code splitting is helpful as we have multiple entry-points\nthat currently duplicate code. With code splitting these entry-points\nwould share common code instead.\n\nPR Close #43932",
