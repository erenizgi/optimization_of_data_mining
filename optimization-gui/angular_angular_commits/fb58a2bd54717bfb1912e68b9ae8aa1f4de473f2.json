This caused them to be treated as external URLs,\nwhich had the following downsides:\n- Links would always point to `angular.io` instead of the same version\n  as the error page (e.g. `next.angular.io` or `v11.angular.io`).\n- Dgeni would not be able to check that the URLs are valid (i.e. point\n  to existing pages).\n- An external link icon would incorrectly be shown next to the links on\n  `angular.io`.\n\nThis commit fixes the links to use relative URLs.\n\nPR Close #40881",

Angular only throws this error in development mode.\n \n In dev mode, Angular performs an additional check after each change detection run, to ensure the bindings haven’t changed. This catches errors where the view is left in an inconsistent state. This can occur, for example, if a method or getter returns a different value each time it is called, or if a child component changes values on its parent. If either of these occur, this is a sign that change detection is not stabilized.
