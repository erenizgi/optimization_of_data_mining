If you were mutating them (e.g. calling `sort()`, `push()`, `splice()`, etc.)\n-then your code will no longer compile. If you need to mutate the array, you\n-should now make a copy (e.g. by calling `slice()`) and mutate the copy.\n-* **common:** When passing a date-time formatted string to the `DatePipe` in a format that contains\n-fractions of a millisecond, the milliseconds will now always be rounded down rather than\n-to the nearest millisecond. Most applications will not be affected by this change. If this is not the desired behaviour\n-then consider pre-processing the string to round the millisecond part before passing\n-it to the `DatePipe`.\n-* **common:** The `slice` pipe now returns `null` for the `undefined` input value,\n-which is consistent with the behavior of most pipes. If you rely on\n-`undefined` being the result in that case, you now need to check for it\n-explicitly.\n-* **common:** The typing of the `keyvalue` pipe has been fixed to report that for\n-input objects that have `number` keys, the result will contain the\n-string representation of the keys. This was already the case and the\n-types have simply been updated to reflect this. Please update the\n-consumers of the pipe output if they were relying on the incorrect\n-types. Note that this does not affect use cases where the input values\n-are `Map`s, so if you need to preserve `number`s, this is an effective\n-way.\n-* **common:** The signatures of the number pipes now explicitly state which types are\n-accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n-values would result in runtime exceptions.\n-* **common:** The signature of the `date` pipe now explicitly states which types are\n-accepted. This should only cause issues in corner cases, as any other\n-values would result in runtime exceptions.\n-* **common:** The `async` pipe no longer claims to return `undefined` for an input that\n-was typed as `undefined`. Note that the code actually returned `null` on\n-`undefined` inputs. In the unlikely case you were relying on this,\n-please fix the typing of the consumers of the pipe output.\n-* **common:** The case conversion pipes no longer let falsy values through. They now\n-map both `null` and `undefined` to `null` and raise an exception on\n-invalid input (`0`, `false`, `NaN`) just like most \"common pipes\". If\n-your code required falsy values to pass through, you need to handle them\n-explicitly.\n-* **compiler:** TypeScript 3.9 is no longer supported, please upgrade to TypeScript 4.0.\n-* **compiler-cli:** Expressions within ICUs are now type-checked again, fixing a regression\n-in Ivy. This may cause compilation failures if errors are found in\n-expressions that appear within an ICU. Please correct these expressions\n-to resolve the type-check errors.\n-* **core:** `CollectionChangeRecord` has been removed, use `IterableChangeRecord` instead.\n-* **core:** If you call `TestBed.overrideProvider` after TestBed initialization, provider overrides are not applied. This\n-behavior is consistent with other override methods (such as `TestBed.overrideDirective`, etc) but they\n-throw an error to indicate that, when the check was missing in the `TestBed.overrideProvider` function.\n-Now calling `TestBed.overrideProvider` after `TestBed` initialization also triggers an\n-error, thus there is a chance that some tests (where `TestBed.overrideProvider` is\n-called after `TestBed` initialization) will start to fail and require updates to move `TestBed.overrideProvider` calls\n-before `TestBed` initialization is completed.\n-* **core:** In v10, IE 9, 10, and IE mobile support was deprecated. In v11, Angular framework removes IE 9,\n-10, and IE mobile support completely.\n-Supporting outdated browsers like these increases bundle size, code complexity, and test load,\n-and also requires time and effort that could be spent on improvements to the framework.\n-For example, fixing issues can be more difficult, as a straightforward fix for modern browsers\n-could break old ones that have quirks due to not receiving updates from vendors.\n-* **core:** `ViewEncapsulation.Native` has been removed. Use `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` instead. Existing\n-usages will be updated automatically by `ng update`.\n-* **forms:** Previously if `FormControl`, `FormGroup` and `FormArray` class instances had async validators\n-defined at initialization time, the status change event was not emitted once async validators\n-completed. After this change the status event is emitted into the `statusChanges` observable.\n-If your code relies on the old behavior, you can filter/ignore this additional status change\n-event.\n-* **forms:** Directives in the `@angular/forms` package used to have `any[]` as a type of `validators` and\n-`asyncValidators` arguments in constructors. Now these arguments are properly typed, so if your\n-code relies on directive constructor types it may require some updates to improve type safety.\n-* **forms:** Type of `AbstractFormControl.parent` now includes `null`. `null` is now included in the types of `.parent`. If you don't already have a check for this case,\n-the TypeScript compiler might complain. A v11 migration exists which adds the non-null assertion\n-operator where necessary. In an unlikely case your code was testing the parent against `undefined` with strict equality,\n-you'll need to change this to `=== null` instead, since the parent is now explicitly initialized\n-with `null` instead of being left `undefined`.\n-* **platform-server:** If you use `useAbsoluteUrl` to setup `platform-server`, you now need to\n-also specify `baseUrl`.\n-We are intentionally making this a breaking change in a minor release,\n-because if `useAbsoluteUrl` is set to `true` then the behavior of the\n-application could be unpredictable, resulting in issues that are hard to\n-discover but could be affecting production environments.\n-* **platform-webworker:** @angular/platform-webworker and @angular/platform-webworker-dynamic\n-have been removed as they were deprecated in v8.\n-* **router:** This change corrects the argument order when calling\n-`RouteReuseStrategy#shouldReuseRoute`. Previously, when evaluating child\n-routes, they would be called with the future and current arguments would\n-be swapped. If your `RouteReuseStrategy` relies specifically on only the future\n-or current snapshot state, you may need to update the `shouldReuseRoute`\n-implementation's use of \"future\" and \"current\" `ActivatedRouteSnapshot`s.\n-* **router:** While the new parameter types allow a variable of type\n-`NavigationExtras` to be passed in, they will not allow object literals,\n-as they may only specify known properties. They will also not accept\n-types that do not have properties in common with the ones in the `Pick`.\n-To fix this error, only specify properties from the `NavigationExtras` which are\n-actually used in the respective function calls or use a type assertion\n-on the object or variable: `as NavigationExtras`.\n-* **router:** This commit changes the default value of\n-`relativeLinkResolution` from `'legacy'` to `'default'`. If your\n-application previously used the default by not specifying a value in the\n-`ExtraOptions` and uses relative links when navigating from children of\n-empty path routes, you will need to update your `RouterModule` to\n-specifically specify `'legacy'` for `relativeLinkResolution`.\n-See https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions#relativeLinkResolution\n-for more details.\n-* **router:** The `initialNavigation` property for the options in\n-`RouterModule.forRoot` no longer supports `legacy_disabled`,\n-`legacy_enabled`, `true`, or `false` as valid values.\n-`legacy_enabled` (the old default) is instead `enabledNonBlocking`.\n-* **router:** `enabled` is deprecated as a valid value for the\n-`RouterModule.forRoot` `initialNavigation` option. `enabledBlocking`\n-has been introduced to replace it.\n-* **router:** `preserveQueryParams` has been removed, use\n-`queryParamsHandling: \"preserve\"` instead.\n-* **router:**  If you were accessing the `RouterLink` values of `queryParams`,\n-`fragment` or `queryParamsHandling` you might need to relax the typing to also\n-accept `undefined` and `null`.
