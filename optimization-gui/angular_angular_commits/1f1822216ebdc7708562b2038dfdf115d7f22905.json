Most applications should consume the new types seamlessly. Any breakage caused by this change is likely due to one of the following two problems: (1) the app is comparing `AbstractControl.status` against a string which is not a valid status; or, (2) the app is using `statusChanges` events as if they were something other than strings.\n+### router\n+The default url serializer would previously drop\n+everything after and including a question mark in query parameters. That\n+is, for a navigation to `/path?q=hello?&other=123`, the query\n+params would be parsed to just `{q: 'hello'}`. This is\n+incorrect because the URI spec allows for question mark characers in\n+query data. This change will now correctly parse the params for the\n+above example to be `{v: 'hello?', other: '123'}`.\n+## Special Thanks:\n+Amadou Sall, Andrew Kushnir, Andrew Scott, Daniel Trevino, Dylan Hunn, Erik Slack, Fabien BERNARD, George Kalpakas, Jeroen van Warmerdam, Joey Perrott, Jon Rimmer, Tim Gates and Vugar_Abdullayev\n+\n+\n <a name=\"12.2.1\"></a>\n # 12.2.1 (2021-08-11)\n ### router"
