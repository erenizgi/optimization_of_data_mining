It uses the starter Angular application created by the CLI command [`ng new`](cli/new) as an example.\n-\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-{@a asp-net-4}\n-\n-## ASP.NET 4.x Project\n-\n-To set up the Getting Started files with an **ASP.NET 4.x project** in\n-Visual Studio 2015, follow these steps:\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-\n-\n-If you prefer a `File | New Project` experience and are using **ASP.NET Core**, \n-then consider the _experimental_\n-<a href=\"https://blog.stevensanderson.com/2016/10/04/angular2-template-for-visual-studio/\">ASP.NET Core + Angular template for Visual Studio 2015</a>.\n-Note that the resulting code does not map to the docs. Adjust accordingly.\n-\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='prereq1'>\n-  Prerequisite: Node.js\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n-\n-Install **[Node.js® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**\n-if they are not already on your machine.\n-See [Local Environment Setup](guide/setup-local \"Setting up for Local Development\") for supported versions and instructions.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='prereq2'>\n-  Prerequisite: Visual Studio 2015 Update 3\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n-\n-The minimum requirement for developing Angular applications with Visual Studio is Update 3.\n-Earlier versions do not follow the best practices for developing applications with TypeScript.\n-To view your version of Visual Studio 2015, go to `Help | About Visual Studio`.\n-\n-If you don't have it, install **[Visual Studio 2015 Update 3](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2015-update3-vs)**.\n-Or use `Tools | Extensions and Updates` to update to Update 3 directly from Visual Studio 2015.\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='prereq3'>\n-  Prerequisite: Configure External Web tools\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n-\n-Configure Visual Studio to use the global external web tools instead of the tools that ship with Visual Studio:\n-\n-  * Open the **Options** dialog with `Tools` | `Options`.\n-  * In the tree on the left, select `Projects and Solutions` | `External Web Tools`.\n-  * On the right, move the `$(PATH)` entry above the `$(DevEnvDir`) entries. This tells Visual Studio to\n-    use the external tools (such as npm) found in the global path before using its own version of the external tools.\n-  * Click OK to close the dialog.\n-  * Restart Visual Studio for this change to take effect.\n-\n-Visual Studio now looks first for external tools in the current workspace and \n-if it doesn't find them, it looks in the global path. If Visual Studio doesn't \n-find them in either location, it will use its own versions of the tools.\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='prereq4'>\n-  Prerequisite: Install TypeScript for Visual Studio 2015\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n-\n-While Visual Studio Update 3 ships with TypeScript support out of the box, it currently doesn’t ship with more recent versions of TypeScript, which you need to develop Angular applications.\n-\n-To install the latest version of TypeScript:\n-\n- * Download and install the latest [TypeScript for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593),\n-\n- * OR install it with npm: `npm install -g typescript@latest`.\n-\n-You can find out more about TypeScript support in Visual Studio **[here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-1/)**.\n-\n-At this point, Visual Studio is ready. It’s a good idea to close Visual Studio and \n-restart it to make sure everything is clean.\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='download'>\n-  Step 1: Create a starter Angular app\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n- Follow the instructions in [Local Environment Setup](guide/setup-local \"Setting up for Local Development\") to create a starter Angular app using the CLI command [`ng new`](cli/new).\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='create-project'>\n-  Step 2: Create the Visual Studio ASP.NET project\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n-\n-Create the ASP.NET 4.x project in the usual way as follows:\n-\n-* In Visual Studio, select `File` | `New` | `Project` from the menu.\n-* In the template tree, select `Templates` | `Visual C#` (or `Visual Basic`) | `Web`.\n-* Select the `ASP.NET Web Application` template, give the project a name, and click OK.\n-* Select the desired ASP.NET 4.5.2 template and click OK.\n-\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-\n-\n-This cookbook uses the `Empty` template with no added folders, \n-no authentication, and no hosting. Pick the template and options appropriate for your project.\n-\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='copy'>\n-  Step 3: Copy the Angular project files into the ASP.NET project folder\n-</h2>\n-\n-Copy files from the starter Angular app into the folder containing the `.csproj` file.\n-Include the files in the Visual Studio project as follows:\n-\n-* Click the `Show All Files` button in Solution Explorer to reveal all of the hidden files in the project.\n-* Right-click on each folder/file to be included in the project and select `Include in Project`.\n-  Minimally, include the following folder/files:\n-\n-  * src/app folder (answer *No*  if asked to search for TypeScript Typings)\n-  * src/styles.css\n-  * src/index.html\n-  * package.json\n-  * src/tsconfig.json\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='restore'>\n-  Step 4: Restore the required packages\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n-\n-Restore the packages required for an Angular application as follows:\n-\n-* Right-click on the `package.json` file in Solution Explorer and select `Restore Packages`.\n-  <br>This uses `npm` to install all of the packages defined in the `package.json` file.\n-  It may take some time.\n-* If desired, open the Output window (`View` | `Output`) to watch the npm commands execute.\n-* Ignore the warnings.\n-* When the restore is finished, a message in the bottom message bar of Visual Studio \n-  should say: `Installing packages complete`. Be patient. This could take a while.\n-* Click the `Refresh` icon in Solution Explorer.\n-* **Do not** include the `node_modules` folder in the project. Let it be a hidden project folder.\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2 id='build-and-run'>\n-  Step 5: Build and run the app\n-</h2>\n-\n-\n-\n-First, ensure that `src/index.html` is set as the start page.\n-Right-click `index.html` in Solution Explorer and select option `Set As Start Page`.\n-\n-### To run in VS with F5\n-\n-Most Visual Studio developers like to press the F5 key and see the IIS server come up.\n-To use the IIS server with the Getting Started app, you must make the following three changes.\n-\n-1. In `index.html`, change base href from `<base href=\"/\">` to `<base href=\"/src/\">`.\n-2. Also in `index.html`, change the scripts to use `/node_modules` with a slash \n-instead of `node_modules` without the slash.\n-3. In `src/systemjs.config.js`, near the top of the file, \n-change the npm `path` to `/node_modules/` with a slash.\n-\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-important\">\n-\n-\n-\n-After these changes, `npm start` no longer works.\n-You must choose to configure _either_ for F5 with IIS _or_ for  `npm start` with the lite-server.\n-\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-\n-### For apps that use routing\n-\n-If your app uses routing, you need to teach the server to always return \n-`index.html` when the user asks for an HTML page\n-for reasons explained in the [Deployment](guide/deployment#fallback) guide.\n-\n-Everything seems fine while you move about _within_ the app.\n-But you'll see the problem right away if you refresh the browser\n-or paste a link to an app page (called a \"deep link\") into the browser address bar.\n-\n-You'll most likely get a *404 - Page Not Found* response from the server\n-for any address other than `/` or `/index.html`.\n-\n-You have to configure the server to return `index.html` for requests to these \"unknown\" pages.\n-The `lite-server` development server does out-of-the-box.\n-If you've switched over to F5 and IIS, you have to configure IIS to do it.\n-This section walks through the steps to adapt the Getting Started application.\n-\n-#### Configure IIS rewrite rules\n-\n-Visual Studio ships with IIS Express, which has the rewrite module baked in.\n-However, if you're using regular IIS you'll have to install the rewrite \n-module.\n-\n-Tell Visual Studio how to handle requests for route app pages by adding these\n-rewrite rules near the bottom of the `web.config`:\n-\n-\n-<code-example format='.'>\n-  &lt;system.webServer&gt;\n-    &lt;rewrite&gt;\n-      &lt;rules&gt;\n-        &lt;rule name=\"Angular Routes\" stopProcessing=\"true\"&gt;\n-          &lt;match url=\".*\" /&gt;\n-          &lt;conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\"&gt;\n-            &lt;add input=\"{REQUEST_FILENAME}\" matchType=\"IsFile\" negate=\"true\" /&gt;\n-            &lt;add input=\"{REQUEST_FILENAME}\" matchType=\"IsDirectory\" negate=\"true\" /&gt;\n-          &lt;/conditions&gt;\n-          &lt;action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/src/\" /&gt;\n-        &lt;/rule&gt;\n-      &lt;/rules&gt;\n-    &lt;/rewrite&gt;\n-  &lt;/system.webServer&gt;\n-\n-</code-example>\n-\n-\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-\n-\n-The match url, `<match url=\".*\" />`, will rewrite every request. You'll have to adjust this if \n-you want some requests to get through, such as web API requests.\n-\n-The URL in `<action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/src/\"/>` should \n-match the base href in `index.html`.\n-\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-\n-Build and launch the app with debugger by clicking the **Run** button or by pressing `F5`.\n-\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-\n-\n-It's faster to run without the debugger by pressing `Ctrl-F5`.\n-\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-\n-The default browser opens and displays the Getting Started sample application.\n-\n-Try editing any of the project files. Save and refresh the browser to\n-see the changes."
