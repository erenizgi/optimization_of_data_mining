    "message": "docs: correct flag default values in `--strict` (#37982)\n\nDocs state that `strictInjectionParameters` is true by default in `ng new`, however this is not the case in `10.0.1`. It is only set when `--strict` is provided. Clarified that the `--strict` flag is required.\n\n`strictTemplates` does not mention anything about `--strict`, so I included a similar point that it is `true` when a new project is generated with `--strict`.\n\nPR Close #37982",
