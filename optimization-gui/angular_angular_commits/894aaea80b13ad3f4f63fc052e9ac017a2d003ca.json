    "message": "refactor(elements): remove unneeded Custom Elements polyfill from docs examples (#44214)\n\nIn PR #43975, the `Angular Elements` guide was updated to remove\nmentions of the Custom Elements-related polyfills, since they are no\nlonger necessary in v13+ (due to all CLI projects being ES2015+ and all\nsupported browsers natively supporting Custom Elements).\n\nThis commit updates the related docs example boilerplate to not include\nthe unneeded `@webcomponents/custom-elements` polyfill.\n\nPR Close #44214",
