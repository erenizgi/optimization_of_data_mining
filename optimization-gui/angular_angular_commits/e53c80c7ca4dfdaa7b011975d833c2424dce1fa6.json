    "message": "ci: changes to `packages/common/http` should not require `fw-common` approval (#41887)\n\nCurrently when the change is made to the code inside the `packages/common/http` folder, both `fw-http` and `fw-common` group members are assigned for review. However only `fw-http` is required and should be sufficient. This commit updates the PullApprove config to exclude `packages/common/http` path from the list of folders that `fw-common` \"owns\".\n\nPR Close #41887",
