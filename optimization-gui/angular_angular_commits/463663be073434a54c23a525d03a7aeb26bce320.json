    "message": "test: disable bazel integration test temporarily due to APF v13 (#43431)\n\nTemporarily disables the Bazel integration test as it will not\nwork with the APF v13 output which is strict ESM. We need to\nland some logic in `rules_nodejs` first that would allow an\nESM variant of `@angular/compiler-cli` to work.\n\nOnce this happened and there is a new release, we can re-enable\nthe test and make adjustments for v13 APF (i.e. running the linker\nplugin when creating the rollup bundles).\n\nPR Close #43431",
