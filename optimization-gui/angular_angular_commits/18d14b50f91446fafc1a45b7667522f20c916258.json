    "message": "fix(docs-infra): fix Sass rule resulting in invalid CSS (#43767)\n\nThe way the Sass rule was defined previously resulted in invalid CSS of\nthe form:\n```css\ntable > thead > { ... }\n```\n\nThis, in turn, resulted in a build-time warning:\n```\nWarning:  > styles.9a5a35b070498c08.css:3079:14: warning: Unexpected \"{\"\n    3079 │ table thead > {\n         ╵               ^\n```\n\nThis commit fixes the affected rule (mostly to avoid the warning,\nbecause this change doesn't seem to have any visual difference). It also\nfixes other rules that were currently not affected (because they only\nhad nested rules and no direct styles), but were susceptible to being\naffected in the future.\n\nPR Close #43767",
