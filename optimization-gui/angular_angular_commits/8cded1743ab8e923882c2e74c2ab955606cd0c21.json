This gives you access to the global variables exposed by that library.\n+Instead, download typings for your library (`npm install @types/jquery`) and follow the library installation steps.\n+This gives you access to the global variables exposed by that library.\n \n ### Defining typings for runtime-global libraries\n \n-If the global library you need to use does not have global typings, you can declare them manually as `any` in `src/typings.d.ts`.
