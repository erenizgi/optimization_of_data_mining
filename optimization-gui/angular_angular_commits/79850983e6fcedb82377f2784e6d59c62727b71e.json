    "message": "fix(docs-infra): prevent search-bar from overlapping nav-items (#37938)\n\nAs part of angular.io's responsive layout, the menu shown in the top-bar\nis collapsed into the sidenav on narrow screens at the point where the\nsearch-bar (on the right side of the top-bar) would overlap with the\nmenu's nav-items.\n\nPreviously, the value used as break-point would work on marketing pages,\nwhere the hamburger button is not shown on wide screens. However, on\ndocs pages (where the hamburger button is always shown, pushing the menu\nfurther to the right), the search-bar would still overlap the menu\nnav-items on some resolutions.\n\nThis commit fixes it by raising the screen width threshold at a value\nthat ensures there is no overlap even on pages where the hamburger\nbutton is visible alongside the top-bar menu.\n\nFixes #37937\n\nPR Close #37938",
