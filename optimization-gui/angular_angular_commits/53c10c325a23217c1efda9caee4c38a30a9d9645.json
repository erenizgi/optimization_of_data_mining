We'll r\n \n ## In Progress\n \n-### Faster apps by inlining critical styles in Universal applications\n+### Accelerated debugging and performance profiling with Angular DevTools\n \n-Loading external stylesheets is a blocking operation, which means that the browser can’t start rendering your application until it loads all the referenced CSS. Having render-blocking resources in the header of a page can significantly impact its load performance, for example, its [first contentful paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/). To make apps faster, we’ve been collaborating with the Google Chrome team on inlining critical CSS and loading the rest of the styles asynchronously.\n+We are working on development tooling for Angular that will provide utilities for debugging and performance profiling. This project aims to help developers understand the component structure and the change detection in an Angular application.\n \n-### Improve debugging with better Angular error messages\n+### Improve test times and debugging with automatic test environment tear down\n \n-Error messages often bring limited actionable information to help developers resolve them. We’ve been working on making error messages more discoverable by adding associated codes, developing guides, and other materials to ensure a smoother debugging experience.\n+To improve test time and create better isolation across tests, we want to change <code>[TestBed](https://angular.io/api/core/testing/TestBed)</code> to automatically clean up and tear down the test environment after each test run.\n+\n+### Deprecate and remove IE11 support\n+\n+IE11 has been preventing Angular from taking advantage of some of the modern features of the Web platform. As part of this project we are going to deprecate and remove IE11 support to open the path for modern features that evergreen browsers provide.\n+\n+### Leverage ES2017+ as the default output language\n+\n+Supporting modern browsers will allow us to leverage the more compact, expressive, and performant new syntax of JavaScript. As part of this project we’ll investigate what are the blockers to move forward with this effort and take the steps forward to enable it.\n \n ### Revamp performance dashboards to detect regressions\n \n We have a set of benchmarks that we run against every code change to ensure Angular aligns with our performance standards. To ensure the framework’s runtime does not regress after a code change, we need to refine some of the existing infrastructure the dashboards step on.\n \n+### Enhanced Angular Material components by integrating [MDC Web](https://material.io/develop/web/)\n+\n+MDC Web is a library created by Google's Material Design team that provides reusable primitives for building Material Design components. The Angular team is incorporating these primitives into Angular Material. Using MDC Web will align Angular Material more closely with the Material Design specification, expand accessibility, improve component quality, and improve our team's velocity.\n+\n+### Angular component accessibility\n+\n+We're evaluating components in Angular Material against accessibility standards such as WCAG and working to fix any issues that arise from this process.\n+\n+### Remove legacy [View Engine](https://angular.io/guide/ivy)\n+\n+After the transition of all our internal tooling to Ivy is completed, we will remove the legacy View Engine for reduced Angular conceptual overhead, smaller package size, lower maintenance cost, and lower codebase complexity.\n+\n+### Publish guides on advanced concepts\n+\n+Develop and publish an in-depth guide on change detection. Develop content for performance profiling of Angular applications. Cover how change detection interacts with Zone.js and explain when it gets triggered, how to profile its duration, as well as common practices for performance optimization.\n+\n ### Update our e2e testing strategy\n \n-To ensure we provide a future-proof e2e testing strategy, we want to evaluate the state of Protractor, community innovations, e2e best practices, and explore novel opportunities.\n+To ensure we provide a future-proof e2e testing strategy, we want to evaluate the state of Protractor, community innovations, e2e best practices, and explore novel opportunities. As first steps of the effort, we shared an [RFC](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/5502) and worked with partners to ensure smooth integration between the Angular CLI and state of the art tooling for e2e testing. As the next step, we need to finalize the recommendations and compile a list of resources for the transition.\n \n-### Angular libraries use Ivy\n+## Future\n \n-Earlier in 2020, we shared an [RFC](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38366) for Ivy library distribution. After invaluable feedback from the community, we developed a design of the project. We are now investing in the development of Ivy library distribution, including an update of the library package format to use Ivy compilation, unblock the deprecation of the View Engine library format, and [ngcc](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#ngcc). \n+### Investigate micro frontend architecture for scalable development processes\n \n-### Ensure smooth adoption for future RxJS changes (v7 and beyond)\n+Look into independent deployability and development of large-scale applications to improve efficiency and productivity. The Angular community has an established story for micro frontend support. As part of this effort, we’d investigate what would be the correct abstractions to provide better support.\n \n-We want to ensure Angular developers are taking advantage of the latest capabilities of RxJS and have a smooth transition to the next major releases of the framework. For this purpose, we will explore and document the scope of the changes in v7 and beyond of RxJS and plan an update strategy.\n+### Better developer ergonomics with strict typing for `@angular/forms`\n \n-### Transition the Angular language service to Ivy\n+We will work on implementing stricter type checking for reactive forms. This way, we will allow developers to catch more issues during development time, enable better text editor and IDE support, and improve the type checking for reactive forms.\n \n-The goal of this project is to improve the experience and remove legacy dependency by transitioning the language service to Ivy. Today the language service still uses the View Engine compiler and type checking, even for Ivy applications. We want to use the Ivy template parser and improved type checking for the Angular Language service to match application behavior. This migration will also be a step towards unblocking the removal of View Engine, which will simplify Angular, reduce the npm package size, and improve the framework's maintainability.\n+### Leverage full framework capabilities with Zone.js opt-out\n \n-### Increased security with native [Trusted Types](https://web.dev/trusted-types/) in Angular\n+We are going to design and implement a plan to make Zone.js optional from Angular applications. This way, we will simplify the framework, improve debugging, and reduce application bundle size. Additionally, this will allow us to take advantage of native async/await syntax, which currently Zone.js does not support.\n \n-In collaboration with Google's security team, we're adding support for the new Trusted Types API. This web platform API will help developers build more secure web applications.\n+### Improved build performance with ngc as a tsc plugin distribution\n \n-### Enhanced Angular Material components by integrating [MDC Web](https://material.io/develop/web/)\n+Distributing the Angular compiler as a plugin of the TypeScript compiler will substantially improve developers' build performance and reduce maintenance costs.\n \n-MDC Web is a library created by Google's Material Design team that provides reusable primitives for building Material Design components. The Angular team is incorporating these primitives into Angular Material. Using MDC Web will align Angular Material more closely with the Material Design specification, expand accessibility, improve component quality, and improve our team's velocity.\n+### Support adding directives to host elements\n \n-### Offer Google engineers better integration with Angular and Google's internal server stack\n+A long-standing feature request is to add the ability to add directives to host elements. The feature will allow developers to augment their own components with additional behaviors without using inheritance. The project will require substantial effort in terms of the definition of APIs, semantics, and implementation.\n+\n+### Simplified Angular mental model with optional NgModules\n \n-This is an internal project to add support for Angular front-ends to Google's internal integrated server stack.\n+To simplify the Angular mental model and learning journey, we’ll be working on making NgModules optional. This work will allow developers to develop standalone components and implement an alternative API for declaring the component’s compilation scope.\n+\n+### Ergonomic component level code-splitting APIs\n+\n+A common problem with web applications is their slow initial load time. A way to improve it is to apply more granular code-splitting on a component level. To encourage this practice, we’ll be working on more ergonomic code-splitting APIs.\n+\n+<details class=\"roadmap-done-details\">\n+<summary class=\"roadmap-done-summary\"><h2>Done</h2></summary>\n \n ### Streamline releases with consolidated Angular versioning & branching\n \n+_Completed Q2 2021_\n+\n We want to consolidate release management tooling between Angular's multiple GitHub repositories ([angular/angular](https://github.com/angular/angular), [angular/angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), and [angular/components](https://github.com/angular/components)).

Test harnesses allow component authors to create supported APIs for testing component interactions. We're continuing to improve this harness infrastructure and clarifying the best practices around using harnesses. We're also working to drive more harness adoption inside of Google.\n \n-### Improved test times and debugging with automatic test environment tear down\n+### Author a guide for content projection\n \n-To improve test time and create better isolation across tests, we want to change `TestBed` to automatically clean up and tear down the test environment after each test run.\n+_Completed Q2 2021_\n \n-### Improved build performance with ngc as a tsc plugin distribution\n+Content projection is a core Angular concept that does not have the presence it deserves in the documentation. As part of this project we want to identify the core use cases and concepts for content projection and document them.\n \n-Distributing the Angular compiler as a plugin of the TypeScript compiler will substantially improve developers' build performance and reduce maintenance costs.\n+### Migrate to ESLint\n \n-### Support adding directives to host elements\n+_Completed Q4 2020_\n \n-A long-standing feature request is to add the ability to add directives to host elements. The feature will allow developers to augment their own components with additional behaviors without using inheritance. The project will require substantial effort in terms of the definition of APIs, semantics, and implementation.\n+With the deprecation of TSLint we will be moving to ESLint. As part of the process, we will work on ensuring backward compatibility with our current recommended TSLint configuration, implement a migration strategy for existing Angular applications and introduce new tooling to the Angular CLI toolchain.\n \n-### Simplified Angular mental model with optional NgModules\n+### Operation Bye Bye Backlog (aka Operation Byelog)\n \n-To simplify the Angular mental model and learning journey, we’ll be working on making NgModules optional. This work will allow developers to develop standalone components and implement an alternative API for declaring the component’s compilation scope.\n+_Completed Q4 2020_\n \n-### Ergonomic component level code-splitting APIs\n+We are actively investing up to 50% of our engineering capacity on triaging issues and PRs until we have a clear understanding of broader community needs. After that, we'll commit up to 20% of our engineering capacity to keep up with new submissions promptly.\n \n-A common problem of web applications is their slow initial load time.
