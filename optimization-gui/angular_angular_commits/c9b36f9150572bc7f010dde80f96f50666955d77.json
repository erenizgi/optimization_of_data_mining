    "message": "fix(dev-infra): fix error message in `invokeSetNpmDistCommand()` function (#39229)\n\nIn #39135, the commit message string was accidentally changed from a\ntemplate literal to a regular string literal. This prevented the\n`npmDistTag` variable from being correctly displayed in the error\nmessage.\n\nThis commit fixes it by switching it back to a template literal.\n\nNOTE:\nThis was pointed out in\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39135#discussion_r503361412, but\nthe PR was accidentally merged before the review feedback had been\naddressed.\n\nPR Close #39229",
