This does not answer the question why it is different. Also, last sentence is confusing.-->\n-NgModules are classes decorated with `@NgModule`. The `@NgModule` decorator’s `imports` array tells Angular what other NgModules the current module needs. The modules in the `imports` array are different than JavaScript modules because they are NgModules rather than regular JavaScript modules. Classes with an `@NgModule` decorator are by convention kept in their own files, but what makes them an `NgModule` isn’t being in their own file, like JavaScript modules; it’s the presence of `@NgModule` and its metadata.\n+An [NgModule](guide/glossary#ngmodule \"Definition of NgModule\") is a class marked by the `@NgModule` decorator with a metadata object that describes how that particular part of the app fits together with the other parts.\n+NgModules are specific to Angular.\n+While classes with an `@NgModule` decorator are by convention kept in their own files, they differ from JavaScript modules because they include this metadata.\n \n-The `AppModule` generated from the [Angular CLI](cli) demonstrates both kinds of modules in action:\n+The `@NgModule` metadata plays an important role in guiding the Angular compilation process that converts the app code you write into highly performant JavaScript code.\n+The metadata describes how to compile a component's template and how to create an [injector](guide/glossary#injector \"Definition of injector\") at runtime.\n+It identifies the NgModule's [components](guide/glossary#component \"Definition of component\"), [directives](guide/glossary#directive \"Definition of directive\"), and [pipes](guide/glossary#pipe \"Definition of pipe)\"),\n+and makes some of them public through the `exports` property so that external components can use them.\n+You can also use an NgModule to add [providers](guide/glossary#provider \"Definition of provider\") for [services](guide/glossary#service \"Definition of a service\"), so that the services are available elsewhere in your app.\n \n-```typescript\n-/* These are JavaScript import statements. Angular doesn’t know anything about these. */\n-import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n-import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n+Rather than defining all member classes in one giant file as a JavaScript module, declare which components, directives, and pipes belong to the NgModule in the `@NgModule.declarations` list.\n+These classes are called [declarables](guide/glossary#declarable \"Definition of a declarable\").\n+An NgModule can export only the declarable classes it owns or imports from other NgModules.\n+It doesn't declare or export any other kind of class.\n+Declarables are the only classes that matter to the Angular compilation process.\n \n-import { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n+For a complete description of the NgModule metadata properties, see [Using the NgModule metadata](guide/ngmodule-api \"Using the NgModule metadata\").\n \n-/* The @NgModule decorator lets Angular know that this is an NgModule. */\n-@NgModule({\n-  declarations: [\n-    AppComponent\n-  ],\n-  imports: [     /* These are NgModule imports. */\n-    BrowserModule\n-  ],\n-  providers: [],\n-  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n-})\n-export class AppModule { }\n-```\n+## An example that uses both\n+\n+The root NgModule `AppModule` generated by the [Angular CLI](cli) for a new app project demonstrates how you use both kinds of modules:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"ngmodules/src/app/app.module.1.ts\" header=\"src/app/app.module.ts (default AppModule)\"></code-example>\n+\n+The root NgModule starts with `import` statements to import JavaScript modules.\n+It then configures the `@NgModule` with the following arrays:\n \n+* `declarations`: The components, directives, and pipes that belong to the NgModule.\n+  A new app project's root NgModule has only one component, called `AppComponent`.\n \n-The NgModule classes differ from JavaScript module in the following key ways:\n+* `imports`: Other NgModules you are using, so that you can use their declarables.\n+  The newly generated root NgModule imports [`BrowserModule`](api/platform-browser/BrowserModule \"BrowserModule NgModule\") in order to use browser-specific services such as [DOM](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html \"Definition of Document Object Model\") rendering, sanitization, and location.\n \n-* An NgModule bounds [declarable classes](guide/ngmodule-faq#q-declarable) only.\n-Declarables are the only classes that matter to the [Angular compiler](guide/ngmodule-faq#q-angular-compiler).\n-* Instead of defining all member classes in one giant file as in a JavaScript module,\n-you list the module's classes in the `@NgModule.declarations` list.\n-* An NgModule can only export the [declarable classes](guide/ngmodule-faq#q-declarable)\n-it owns or imports from other modules.
