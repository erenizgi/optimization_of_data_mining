The `ng-` prefix is a reserved keyword used from the Angular framework and its libraries. The `ngx-` prefix is preferred as a convention used to denote that the library is suitable for use with Angular. It is also an excellent indication to consumers of the registry to differentiate between libraries of different JavaScript frameworks.\n+\n+</div>\n+\n The `ng generate` command creates the `projects/my-lib` folder in your workspace, which contains a component and a service inside an NgModule.\n \n <div class=\"alert is-helpful\">"
