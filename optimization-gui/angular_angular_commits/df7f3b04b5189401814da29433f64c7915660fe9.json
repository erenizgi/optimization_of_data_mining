    "message": "fix(service-worker): fix the chrome debugger syntax highlighter (#38332)\n\nThe Chrome debugger is not able to render the syntax properly when the\ncode contains backticks. This is a known issue in Chrome and they have an\nopen [issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=659515) for that.\nThis commit adds the work-around to use double backslash with one\nbacktick ``\\\\` `` at the end of the line.\n\nThis can be reproduced by running the following command:\n\n`yarn bazel test //packages/forms/test --config=debug`\n\nWhen opening the chrome debugger tools, you should see the correct\ncode highlighting syntax.\n\nPR Close #38332",
