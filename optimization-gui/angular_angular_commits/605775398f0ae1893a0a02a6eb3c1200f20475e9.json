    "message": "docs(router): Clarify 'parent' for params inheritance (#40304)\n\nWhen talking about parameter inheritance, one might think that matrix\nparameters can be inherited from the \"parent\" segment, or the segment\nwhich appears immediately to the left. In reality, when we talk about\na \"parent\" in the `Router`, we mean the parent `Route` config. This\nconfig may contain more than one segment and matrix parameters must\nappear at the end or they do not \"belong\" to any config.\n\nPR Close #40304",
