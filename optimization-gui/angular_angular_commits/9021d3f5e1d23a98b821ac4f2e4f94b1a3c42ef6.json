    "message": "docs: fix live examples in testing guides (#38038)\n\nIn #37957, parts of the testing guide were broken out into separate\nguides. As part of that work, the `<live-example>` tags were also copied\nto the new guides. These `<live-example>` tags did not specify the\ntargeted example project via the `name` attribute, thus they were\nimplicitly targeting the example with the same name as the guide they\nwere in. See the [Docs style guide][1] for more info.\n\nHowever, there is only one example project (`testing/`) and all\n`<live-example>` tags were supposed to target that. This worked fine on\nthe `testing.md` guide, but it broke on other guides (which tried to\ntarget non-existing example projects based on their names).\n\nThis commit fixes it by explicitly specifying which example is targeted\nby the `<live-example>` tags. It also removes the `embedded-style`\nattribute that has no effect.\n\n[1]: https://angular.io/guide/docs-style-guide#live-examples\n\nFixes #38036\n\nPR Close #38038",
