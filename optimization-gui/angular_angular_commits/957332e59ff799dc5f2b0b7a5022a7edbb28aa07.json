You need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one, and then [create a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) for your project.\n-Make a note of the user name and project name in GitHub.\n+1.

Build your project using Github project name, with the Angular CLI command [`ng build`](cli/build) and the options shown here:\n+1. Configure `git` in your local project by adding a remote that specifies the GitHub repo you created in previous step.\n+  GitHub provides these commands when you create the repo so that you can copy and paste them at your command prompt.\n+  The commands should be similar to the following, though GitHub fills in your project-specific settings for you:\n+\n+  ```sh\n+  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git\n+  git branch -M main\n+  git push -u origin main\n+  ```\n+  When you paste these commands from GitHub, they run automatically.\n+\n+1. Create and check out a `git` branch named `gh-pages`.\n+\n+  ```sh\n+  git checkout -b gh-pages\n+  ```\n+\n+1. Build your project using the Github project name, with the Angular CLI command [`ng build`](cli/build) and the following options, where `your_project_name` is the name of the project that you gave the GitHub repository in step 1.\n+\n+  Be sure to include the slashes on either side of your project name as in `/your_project_name/`.\n \n   <code-example language=\"none\" class=\"code-shell\">\n \n-    ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /&lt;project_name&gt;/\n+    ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /your_project_name/\n \n   </code-example>\n \n 1.
