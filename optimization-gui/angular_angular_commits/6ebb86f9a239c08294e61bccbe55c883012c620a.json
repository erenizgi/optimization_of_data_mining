Maintaining support for IE11 incurs ongoing costs, including increased bundle size, code complexity, and test load. Global usage of IE11 has fallen to a point where these costs no longer warrant the additional maintenance effort. Ending IE11 support additionally allows Angular to take advantage of platform APIs present only in evergreen browsers.\n+Angular support for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) is deprecated and will be removed in Angular v13.\n+Ending IE11 support allows Angular to take advantage of web platform APIs present only in evergreen browsers, resulting in better APIs for developers and more capabilities for application users.\n+An additional motivation behind this removal is the drop in global usage of IE11 to just ~1% (as of March 2021).\n+For full rationale and discussion behind this deprecation see [RFC: Internet Explorer 11 support deprecation and removal](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41840).\n \n-Microsoft announced that its 365 services will no longer support IE11 starting August 17, 2021. Microsoft previously ended support for IE11 in Microsoft Teams on November 30, 2020. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 apps say farewell to Internet Explorer 11](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666).\n+*Note: IE11 will be supported in Angular v12 LTS releases through November 2022.*\n \n {@a deprecated-cli-flags}\n ## Deprecated CLI APIs and Options"
