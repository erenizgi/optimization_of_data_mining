    "message": "test(platform-browser): complete component bootstrap before switching to the next test (#43933)\n\nThe bootstrap tests that reused the same component (the `HelloRootCmp` one) were randomly failing due to the incomplete cleanup between tests. This commit ensures that the component bootstrap is fully cimpleted and there are no pending async actions before going to the next test.\n\nPR Close #43933",
