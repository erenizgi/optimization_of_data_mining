This commit changes\nall occurrences of `hotlist: community-help` in the documentation to\n`help wanted` and also documents the purpose of the `help wanted` and\n`good first issue` labels.\n\n[1]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-labels#about-default-labels\n\nPR Close #41195",
