ESbuild will automatically downlevel the ES2020 features\nwe currently use to make them compatible with NodeJS v12 <-> ES2019.\n\nES2020 is the prodmode output, but we still support Node v12 so\nthere needs to be some downleveling for now.\n\nNote: This is a separate commit because initially the target was\nset to Node v14 to match up with the prodmode Bazel output.\n\nPR Close #43431",
