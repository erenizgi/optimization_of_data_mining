    "message": "build: add .gitmessage file with commit message template (#37951)\n\nGit provides a way to create a commit message template via the `.gitmessage` file.\n\nIntroduce an Angular-specific .gitmessage template based on the original Commit Message Guidelines.\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines\n\nIf this template workflow is proven in practice, we can move the commit message guidelines into the\n.gitmessage file to prevent duplication of the content.\n\nThis change is a follow up on #37949 and is inspired by info found in the following blog post:\nhttps://thoughtbot.com/blog/better-commit-messages-with-a-gitmessage-template\n\nPR Close #37951",
