    "message": "build: use correct target name (#44651)\n\nDev mode output was switched from ES5 -> ES2015 recently and as a part of those changes, some target names that contained `_es5` postfixes were changes to `_es2015` instead. This commit fixes the issue with one of the recently merged BUILD files that contained the old (`_es5`) postfix.\n\nPR Close #44651",
