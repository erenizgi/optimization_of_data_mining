    "message": "fix(docs-infra): better distinguish wrapped headings from other entries in TOC (#39092)\n\nPreviously, when a heading was longer than the Table of Content's  (TOC)\nwidth and it had to be wrapped into multiple lines, it was hard to\ndistinguish the subsequent lines from other TOC entries (i.e. other\nheadings).\n\nThis commit makes it easier to visually distinguish wrapped heading\nlines from other headings by reducing the spacing between wrapped lines\nof the same heading (making it more obvious that they belong together).\n\nPR Close #39092",
