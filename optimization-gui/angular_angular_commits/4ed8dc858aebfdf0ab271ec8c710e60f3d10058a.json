    "message": "docs: remove Ivy-specific guides (#43860)\n\nIvy is the only supported rendering engine in v13, so there is no need to document the concept. Everything in Angular is Ivy. This starts the removal process by deleting Ivy-specific guides and references to them. It also updates the glossary to be more clear that Ivy is the current rendering engine while View Engine is simply a historical note.\n\nThis does not attempt to fully remove all references to \"Ivy\" or \"View Engine\", that will likely be a more involved clean up process.\n\nPR Close #43860",

Many of these examples list error messages you may see, so searching by error message might be a good idea if you are debugging.\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-critical\">\n-NOTE: Most of these issues affect a small percentage of applications encountering unusual or rare edge cases.\n-</div>\n-\n-\n-{@a content-children-descendants}\n-## @ContentChildren queries only match direct children by default\n-\n-\n-### Basic example of change\n-\n-Let's say a component (`Comp`) has a `@ContentChildren` query for `'foo'`:\n-\n-```html\n-<comp>\n-    <div>\n-         <div #foo></div>   <!-- matches in old runtime, not in new runtime -->\n-    </div>\n-</comp>\n-```\n-\n-In the previous runtime, the `<div>` with `#foo` would match.\n-With Ivy, that `<div>` does not match because it is not a direct child of `<comp>`.\n-\n-\n-### Background\n-\n-By default, `@ContentChildren` queries have the `descendants` flag set to `false`.\n-\n-In the previous rendering engine, \"descendants\" referred to \"descendant directives\".\n-An element could be a match as long as there were no other directives between the element and the requesting directive.\n-This made sense for directives with nesting like tabs, where nested tab directives might not be desirable to match.\n-However, this caused surprising behavior for users because adding an unrelated directive like `ngClass` to a wrapper element could invalidate query results.\n-\n-For example, with the content query and template below, the last two `Tab` directives would not be matches:\n-\n-```\n-@ContentChildren(Tab, {descendants: false}) tabs: QueryList<Tab>\n-```\n-\n-```\n-<tab-list>\n-  <div>\n-    <tab> One </tab>     <!-- match (nested in element) -->\n-  </div>\n-  <tab>                  <!-- match (top level) -->\n-    <tab> A </tab>       <!-- not a match (nested in tab) -->\n-  </tab>\n-  <div [ngClass]=\"classes\">\n-    <tab> Two </tab>     <!-- not a match (nested in ngClass) -->\n-  </div>\n-</tab-list>\n-```\n-\n-In addition, the differences between type and string predicates were subtle and sometimes unclear.\n-For example, if you replace the type predicate above with a `'foo'` string predicate, the matches change:\n-\n-```\n-@ContentChildren('foo', {descendants: false}) foos: QueryList<ElementRef>\n-```\n-\n-```\n-<tab-list>\n-  <div>\n-    <div #foo> One </div>     <!-- match (nested in element) -->\n-  </div>\n-  <tab #foo>                  <!-- match (top level) -->\n-    <div #foo> A </div>       <!-- match (nested in tab) -->\n-  </tab>\n-  <div [ngClass]=\"classes\">\n-    <div #foo> Two </div>     <!-- match (nested in ngClass) -->\n-  </div>\n-</tab-list>\n-```\n-\n-Because the previous behavior was inconsistent and surprising to users, we did not want to reproduce it in Ivy.\n-Instead, we simplified the mental model so that \"descendants\" refers to DOM nesting only.\n-Any DOM element between the requesting component and a potential match will invalidate that match.\n-Type predicates and string predicates also have identical matching behavior.\n-\n-Ivy behavior for directive/string predicates:\n-```\n-<tab-list>\n-  <div>\n-    <tab> One </tab>     <!-- not a match (nested in element) -->\n-  </div>\n-  <tab>                  <!-- match (top level) -->\n-    <tab> A </tab>       <!-- not a match (nested in tab) -->\n-  </tab>\n-  <div [ngClass]=\"classes\">\n-    <tab> Two </tab>     <!-- not a match (nested in div) -->\n-  </div>\n-</tab-list>\n-```\n-\n-\n-### Example of error\n-\n-The error message that you see will depend on how the particular content query is used in the application code.\n-Frequently, an error is thrown when a property is referenced on the content query result (which is now `undefined`).\n-\n-For example, if the component sets the content query results to a property, `foos`, `foos.first.bar` would throw the error:\n-\n-```\n-Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'bar' of undefined\n-```\n-\n-If you see an error like this, and the `undefined` property refers to the result of a `@ContentChildren` query, it may well be caused by this change.\n-\n-\n-### Recommended fix\n-\n-You can either add the `descendants: true` flag to ignore wrapper elements or remove the wrapper elements themselves.\n-\n-Option 1:\n-```\n-@ContentChildren('foo', {descendants: true}) foos: QueryList<ElementRef>;\n-```\n-\n-Option 2:\n-```\n-<comp>\n-   <div #foo></div>   <!-- matches in both old runtime and  new runtime -->\n-</comp>\n-```\n-\n-{@a undecorated-classes}\n-## All classes that use Angular DI must have an Angular class-level decorator\n-\n-\n-### Basic example of change:\n-\n-In the previous rendering engine, the following would work:\n-\n-```\n-export class DataService {\n-  constructor(@Inject('CONFIG') public config: DataConfig) {}\n-}\n-\n-@Injectable()\n-export class AppService extends DataService {...}\n-```\n-\n-In Ivy, it will throw an error because `DataService` is using Angular dependency injection, but is missing an `@Injectable` decorator.\n-\n-The following would also work in the previous rendering engine, but in Ivy would require a `@Directive` decorator because it uses DI:\n-\n-```\n-export class BaseMenu {\n-  constructor(private vcr: ViewContainerRef) {}\n-}\n-\n-@Directive({selector: '[settingsMenu]'})\n-export class SettingsMenu extends BaseMenu {}\n-```\n-\n-The same is true if your directive class extends a decorated directive, but does not have a decorator of its own.\n-\n-If you're using the CLI, there are two automated migrations that should transition your code for you ([this one](guide/migration-injectable) and [this one](guide/migration-undecorated-classes)).\n-However, as you're adding new code in version 9, you may run into this difference.\n-\n-### Background\n-\n-When a class has an Angular decorator like `@Injectable` or `@Directive`, the Angular compiler generates extra code to support injecting dependencies into the constructor of your class.\n-When using inheritance, Ivy needs both the parent class and the child class to apply a decorator to generate the correct code.\n-Otherwise, when the decorator is missing from the parent class, the subclass will inherit a constructor from a class for which the compiler did not generate special constructor info, and Angular won't have the dependency info it needs to create it properly.\n-\n-In the previous rendering engine, the compiler had global knowledge, so in some cases (such as AOT mode or the presence of certain injection flags), it could look up the missing data.\n-However, the Ivy compiler only processes each class in isolation.\n-This means that compilation has the potential to be faster (and opens the framework up for optimizations and features going forward), but the compiler can't automatically infer the same information as before.\n-\n-Adding the proper decorator explicitly provides this information.\n-\n-### Example of error\n-\n-In JIT mode, the framework will throw the following error:\n-\n-```\n-ERROR: This constructor is not compatible with Angular Dependency Injection because its dependency at index X of the parameter list is invalid.\n-This can happen if the dependency type is a primitive like a string or if an ancestor of this class is missing an Angular decorator.\n-\n-Please check that 1) the type for the parameter at index X is correct and 2) the correct Angular decorators are defined for this class and its ancestors.\n-```\n-\n-In AOT mode, you'll see something like:\n-\n-```\n-X inherits its constructor from Y, but the latter does not have an Angular decorator of its own.\n-Dependency injection will not be able to resolve the parameters of Y's constructor.

Angular would process the template one full time to check directive inputs only (e.g. `[name]`), then process the whole template again to check element and text bindings only (e.g.`{{ myDir.name }}`). This meant that the `name` directive input would be checked before the `myDir.name` text binding despite their relative order in the template, which some users felt to be counterintuitive.\n-\n-In contrast, Ivy processes the template in just one pass, so that bindings are checked in the same order that they are written in the template. In this case, it means that the `myDir.name` binding will be checked before the `name` input sets the property on the directive (and thus it will be `undefined`). Since the `myDir.name` property will be set by the time the next change detection pass runs, a change detection error is thrown.\n-\n-### Example of error\n-\n-Assuming that the value for `myName` is `Angular`, you should see an error that looks like\n-\n-```\n-Error: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'undefined'. Current value: 'Angular'.\n-```\n-\n-### Recommended fix\n-\n-To fix this problem, we recommend either getting the information for the binding directly from the host component (e.g. the `myName` property from our example) or to move the data binding after the directive has been declared so that the initial value is available on the first pass.\n-\n-*Before*\n-```html\n-{{ myDir.name }}\n-<div myDir #myDir=\"myDir\" [name]=\"myName\"></div>\n-```\n-\n-*After*\n-```html\n-{{ myName }}\n-<div myDir [name]=\"myName\"></div>\n-```\n-\n-{@a foreign-values}\n-## Foreign functions and foreign values aren't statically resolvable\n-\n-### Basic example of change \n-\n-Consider a library that defines and exports some selector string to be used in other libraries:\n-\n-```\n-export let mySelector = '[my-selector]';\n-```\n-\n-This selector is then imported in another library or an application:\n-\n-```\n-import {mySelector} from 'my-library';\n-\n-@Directive({selector: mySelector})\n-export class MyDirective {}\n-```\n-\n-Because the `mySelector` value is imported from an external library, it is part of a different compilation unit and therefore considered _foreign_.\n-\n-While this code would work correctly in the View Engine compiler, it would fail to compile in Ivy in AOT mode.\n-\n-### Background\n-\n-In View Engine, the compiler would capture the source code of a library in `metadata.json` files when bundling the library, so that external consumers could \"look inside\" the source code of an external library.\n-When AOT-compiling the application, the `metadata.json` files would be used to determine the value of `mySelector`.\n-In Ivy, the `metadata.json` files are no longer used. Instead, the compiler extracts metadata for external libraries from the `.d.ts` files that TypeScript creates.\n-This has several benefits such as better performance, much improved error reporting, and enables more build caching opportunities as there is no longer a dependency on library internals.\n-\n-Looking back at the previous example, the `mySelector` value would be represented in the `.d.ts` as follows:\n-\n-```\n-export declare let mySelector: string;\n-```\n-\n-Notice that the actual value of the selector is no longer present, so that the Ivy compiler is unable to use it during AOT compilations.\n-\n-### Example of error\n-\n-In the above example, a compilation error would occur when compiling `MyDirective`:\n-\n-```\n-error NG1010: selector must be a string\n-  Value is a reference to 'mySelector'.\n-\n-    1  export declare let mySelector: string;\n-                          ~~~~~~~~~~\n-    Reference is declared here.\n-\n-```\n-\n-### Recommended fix\n-\n-When exporting values from a library, ensure the actual value is present in the `.d.ts` file.

In this case, you may want to consult the [general update guide](guide/updating-to-version-12). If you've opted into any of the new, stricter type-checking settings, you may also want to check out the [template type-checking guide](guide/template-typecheck).\n-\n-If the errors are gone, switch back to Ivy by removing the changes to the `tsconfig.json` and review the list of expected changes below.\n-\n-{@a payload-size-debugging}\n-### Payload size debugging\n-\n-If you notice that the size of your application's main bundle has increased with Ivy, you may want to check the following:\n-\n-1. Verify that the components and `NgModules` that you want to be lazy loaded are only imported in lazy modules.\n-Anything that you import outside lazy modules can end up in the main bundle.\n-See more details in the original issue [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16146#issuecomment-557559287).\n-\n-1. Check that imported libraries have been marked side-effect-free.\n-If your application imports from shared libraries that are meant to be free from side effects, add \"sideEffects\": false to their `package.json`.\n-This will ensure that the libraries will be properly tree-shaken if they are imported but not directly referenced.\n-See more details in the original issue [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16799#issuecomment-580912090).\n-\n-1. Projects not using Angular CLI will see a significant size regression unless they update their minifier settings and set compile-time constants `ngDevMode`, `ngI18nClosureMode` and `ngJitMode` to `false` (for Terser, set these to `false` using [`global_defs` config option](https://terser.org/docs/api-reference.html#conditional-compilation)).\n-Note that these constants are not meant to be used by 3rd party library or application code as they are not part of our public api surface and might change in the future.\n-\n-{@a common-changes}\n-### Changes you may see\n-\n-* By default, `@ContentChildren` queries will only search direct child nodes in the DOM hierarchy (previously, they would search any nesting level in the DOM as long as another directive wasn't matched above it). See further [details](guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#content-children-descendants).\n-\n-* All classes that use Angular DI must have an Angular decorator like `@Directive()` or `@Injectable` (previously, undecorated classes were allowed in AOT mode only or if injection flags were used). See further [details](guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#undecorated-classes).\n-\n-* Unbound inputs for directives (for example, name in `<my-comp name=\"\">`) are now set upon creation of the view, before change detection runs (previously, all inputs were set during change detection).\n-\n-* Static attributes set directly in the HTML of a template will override any conflicting host attributes set by directives or components (previously, static host attributes set by directives / components would override static template attributes if conflicting).\n-\n-{@a less-common-changes}\n-### Less common changes\n-\n-* Properties like `host` inside `@Component` and `@Directive` decorators can be inherited (previously, only properties with explicit field decorators like `@HostBinding` would be inherited).\n-\n-* HammerJS support is opt-in through importing the `HammerModule` (previously, it was always included in production bundles regardless of whether the application used HammerJS).\n-\n-* `@ContentChild` and `@ContentChildren` queries will no longer be able to match their directive's own host node (previously, these queries would match the host node in addition to its content children).\n-\n-* If a token is injected with the `@Host` or `@Self` flag, the module injector is not searched for that token (previously, tokens marked with these flags would still search at the module level).\n-\n-* When accessing multiple local refs with the same name in template bindings, the first is matched (previously, the last instance was matched).\n-\n-* Directives that are used in an exported module (but not exported themselves) are exported publicly (previously, the compiler would automatically write a private, aliased export that it could use its global knowledge to resolve downstream).\n-\n-* Foreign functions or foreign constants in decorator metadata aren't statically resolvable (previously, you could import a constant or function from another compilation unit, like a library, and use that constant/function in your `@NgModule` definition).\n-\n-* Forward references to directive inputs accessed through local refs are no longer supported by default. [details](guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#forward-refs-directive-inputs)\n-\n-* If there is both an unbound class attribute and a `[class]` binding, the classes in the unbound attribute will also be added (previously, the class binding would overwrite classes in the unbound attribute).\n-For more information about the updated style precedence in Ivy, refer to the [style precedence guide](guide/style-precedence).\n-\n-* It is now an error to assign values to template-only variables like `item` in `ngFor=\"let item of items\"` (previously, the compiler would ignore these assignments).\n-\n-* It's no longer possible to overwrite lifecycle hooks with mocks on directive instances for testing (instead, modify the lifecycle hook on the directive type itself).\n-\n-* Special injection tokens (such as `TemplateRef` or `ViewContainerRef`) return a new instance whenever they are requested (previously, instances of special tokens were shared if requested on the same node). This primarily affects tests that do identity comparison of these objects.\n-\n-* ICU parsing happens at runtime, so only text, HTML tags and text bindings are allowed inside ICU cases (previously, directives were also permitted inside ICUs).\n-\n-* Adding text bindings into i18n translations that are not present in the source template itself will throw a runtime error (previously, including extra bindings in translations was permitted).\n-\n-* Extra HTML tags in i18n translations that are not present in the source template itself will be rendered as plain text (previously, these tags would render as HTML).\n-\n-* Providers formatted as `{provide: X}` without a `useValue`, `useFactory`, `useExisting`, or `useClass` property are treated like `{provide: X, useClass: X}` (previously, it defaulted to `{provide: X, useValue: undefined}`).\n-\n-* `DebugElement.attributes` returns `undefined` for attributes that were added and then subsequently removed (previously, attributes added and later removed would have a value of `null`).\n-\n-* `DebugElement.classes` returns `undefined` for classes that were added and then subsequently removed (previously, classes added and later removed would have a value of `false`).\n-\n-* If selecting the native `<option>` element in a `<select>` where the `<option>`s are created using `*ngFor`, use the `[selected]` property of an `<option>` instead of binding to the `[value]` property of the `<select>` element (previously, you could bind to either.) [details](guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#select-value-binding)\n-\n-* Embedded views (such as ones created by `*ngFor`) are now inserted in front of anchor DOM comment node (for example, `<!--ng-for-of-->`) rather than behind it as was the case previously.\n-  In most cases this has no impact on rendered DOM.\n-\n-  When animations delay the removal of an embedded view, any new embedded views will be inserted after the embedded view that will be removed once the animation completes.\n-  This difference only lasts while the animation is active, and might alter the visual appearance of the animation.\n-  When the animation is finished, the resulting rendered DOM is identical to that rendered with View Engine.\n-\n-  One additional exception is the `<select>` element with `<option>` elements dynamically rendered using `NgForOf`. If a [`trackBy`](api/common/NgForOf#ngForTrackBy) function is not provided, the selected `<option>` will not be preserved when the iterable used by the `NgForOf` changes.\n-  With View Engine, this programming error was obscured, and often not visible.\n-  To avoid this problem, provide the `trackBy` function to correctly associate the model with the rendered DOM elements."
