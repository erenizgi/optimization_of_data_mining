    "message": "ci: exclude packages which don't have a major from being batched (#41865)\n\nWith this change we exclude packages that are not stable yet from being batched in the `all non-major dependencies`. The reason behind this is that these package can contain breaking changes in minor versions, hence they should be treated as breaking and a PR should be opened separately.\nPR Close #41865",
