    "message": "refactor(platform-browser-dynamic): remove private export of `ResourceLoaderImpl` (#44267)\n\nThis type was exported for the ViewEngine compiler as it needed to\nreference the class in its DI codegen. This is no longer a requirement\nwith Ivy, hence the private export can be removed.\n\nThis change prevents an import of `@angular/compiler` to be referenced\nin the .d.ts file of `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`, which is\nbeneficial for application compilations as that prevents the\n`@angular/compiler` .d.ts files from being included in the `ts.Program`\nof an application.\n\nCloses #44157.\n\nPR Close #44267",
