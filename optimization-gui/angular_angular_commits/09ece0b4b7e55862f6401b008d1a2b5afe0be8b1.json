I\nhave made various changes for quite some time to `@angular/bazel` and\nwith the new APF v13 changes, a lot of code was simplified.\n\nAs one of the primary consumers of `@angular/bazel` (in the name of the\nAngular components repo), I think it would be reasonable to have an eye\non changes to the Bazel package.\n\nPR Close #43431",
