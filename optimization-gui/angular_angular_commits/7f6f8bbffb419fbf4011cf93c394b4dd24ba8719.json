However, most modern browsers no longer support the usage of these expressions, so sanitization was only maintained for the sake of IE 6 and 7. Given that Angular does not support either IE 6 or 7 and sanitization has a performance cost, we will no longer sanitize style bindings as of version 10 of Angular."
