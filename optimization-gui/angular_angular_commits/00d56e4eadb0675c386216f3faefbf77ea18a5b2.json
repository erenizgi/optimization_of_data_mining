    "message": "ci: enable the Selenium Promise Manager in AIO e2e tests to avoid flakiness on CI (#39905)\n\nSince we turned off the Selenium Promise Manager in #39600, the AIO e2e\ntests have started flaking on CI. After trying out several things, the\nonly change that seems to eliminate the flakiness is turning the\nSelenium Promise Manager back on (see #39873 for more details).\n\nThis commit turns the Selenium Project Manager on to get rid of the\nflakiness.\n\nFixes #39872\n\nPR Close #39905",
