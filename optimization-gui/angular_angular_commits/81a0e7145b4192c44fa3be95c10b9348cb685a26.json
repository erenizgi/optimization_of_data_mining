    "message": "ci: fix `elements` test on older browsers (#41324)\n\nSome `elements` tests rely on `window.customElements` being available.\nOn browsers where this was not present, the tests were skipped.\n\nThis commit includes the `@webcomponents/custom-elements` polyfill in\norder to be able to run all `elements` tests on older browsers, which do\nnot natively support Custom Elements.\n\nThis, also, fixes the [saucelabs_ivy][1] and [saucelabs_view_engine][2]\nCI jobs (part of the `monitoring` workflow), which have been failing\nrecently on IE 11 (probably due to the update to TS 4.2.3).\n\n[1]: https://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/944291\n[2]: https://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/944289\n\nPR Close #41324",
