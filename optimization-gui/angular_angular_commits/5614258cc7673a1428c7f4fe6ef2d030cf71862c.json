    "message": "docs(zone.js): Add breaking changes info for zone.js v0.11.1 (#38821)\n\nBefore Zone.js `v0.11.1`, Zone.js provides two format of bundles under `dist` folder,\n`ES5` bundle `zone.js` and `ES2015` bundle `zone-evergreen.js`, these bundles are used\nfor `differential loading` of Angular. By default, the following code\n\n```\nimport 'zone.js';\n```\n\nloads the `ES5` bundle `zone.js`.\n\nFrom `v0.11.1`, Zone.js follows the [Angular Package Format]\n(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs),\nso the folder structure of the Zone.js bundles is updated to match `Angular Package Format`.\n\nSo the same code\n\n```\nimport 'zone.js';\n```\nloads the `ES2015` bundle.\n\nThis is a breaking change, so if the apps import zone.js in this way,\nthe apps will not work in legacy browsers such as `IE11`.\n\nZone.js still provides the same bundles under `dist` folder to keep backward\ncompatibility after `v0.11.1`. So the following code in `polyfills.ts` generated\nby `Angular CLI` still works.\n\n```\nimport 'zone.js/dist/zone';\n```\n\nFor details, please refer the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and\nthe [PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36540).\n\nPR Close #38821",
