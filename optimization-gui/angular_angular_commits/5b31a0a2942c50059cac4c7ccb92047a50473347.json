The first phase breaks out template syntax\ninto multiple documents. The second phase will be\na rewrite of each doc.\n\nSpecifically, this PR does the following:\n\n- Breaks sections of the current template syntax document each into their own page.\n- Corrects the links to and from these new pages.\n- Adds template syntax subsection to the left side NAV which contains all the new pages.\n- Adds the new files to pullapprove.\n\nPR Close #36954",

This applies to data-binding in general. Data-binding works with *properties* of DOM elements, components, and directives, not HTML *attributes*.\n+\n+{@a html-attribute-vs-dom-property}\n+\n+### HTML attribute vs. DOM property\n+\n+The distinction between an HTML attribute and a DOM property is key to understanding\n+how Angular binding works. **Attributes are defined by HTML. Properties are accessed from DOM (Document Object Model) nodes.**\n+\n+* A few HTML attributes have 1:1 mapping to properties; for example, `id`.\n+\n+* Some HTML attributes don't have corresponding properties; for example, `aria-*`.\n+\n+* Some DOM properties don't have corresponding attributes; for example, `textContent`.\n+\n+It is important to remember that *HTML attribute* and the *DOM property* are different things, even when they have the same name.\n+In Angular, the only role of HTML attributes is to initialize element and directive state.\n+\n+**Template binding works with *properties* and *events*, not *attributes*.**\n+\n+When you write a data-binding, you're dealing exclusively with the *DOM properties* and *events* of the target object.\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+This general rule can help you build a mental model of attributes and DOM properties:\n+**Attributes initialize DOM properties and then they are done.\n+Property values can change; attribute values can't.**\n+\n+There is one exception to this rule.\n+Attributes can be changed by `setAttribute()`, which re-initializes corresponding DOM properties.\n+\n+</div>\n+\n+For more information, see the [MDN Interfaces documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API#Interfaces) which has API docs for all the standard DOM elements and their properties.\n+Comparing the [`<td>` attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) attributes to the [`<td>` properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableCellElement) provides a helpful example for differentiation.\n+In particular, you can navigate from the attributes page to the properties via \"DOM interface\" link, and navigate the inheritance hierarchy up to `HTMLTableCellElement`.\n+\n+\n+#### Example 1: an `<input>`\n+\n+When the browser renders `<input type=\"text\" value=\"Sarah\">`, it creates a\n+corresponding DOM node with a `value` property initialized to \"Sarah\".\n+\n+```html\n+<input type=\"text\" value=\"Sarah\">\n+```\n+\n+When the user enters \"Sally\" into the `<input>`, the DOM element `value` *property* becomes \"Sally\".\n+However, if you look at the HTML attribute `value` using `input.getAttribute('value')`, you can see that the *attribute* remains unchanged&mdash;it returns \"Sarah\".\n+\n+The HTML attribute `value` specifies the *initial* value; the DOM `value` property is the *current* value.\n+\n+To see attributes versus DOM properties in a functioning app, see the <live-example name=\"binding-syntax\"></live-example> especially for binding syntax.\n+\n+#### Example 2: a disabled button\n+\n+The `disabled` attribute is another example. A button's `disabled`\n+*property* is `false` by default so the button is enabled.\n+\n+When you add the `disabled` *attribute*, its presence alone\n+initializes the button's `disabled` *property* to `true`\n+so the button is disabled.\n+\n+```html\n+<button disabled>Test Button</button>\n+```\n+\n+Adding and removing the `disabled` *attribute* disables and enables the button.\n+However, the value of the *attribute* is irrelevant,\n+which is why you cannot enable a button by writing `<button disabled=\"false\">Still Disabled</button>`.\n+\n+To control the state of the button, set the `disabled` *property*,\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+Though you could technically set the `[attr.disabled]` attribute binding, the values are different in that the property binding requires to a boolean value, while its corresponding attribute binding relies on whether the value is `null` or not. Consider the following:\n+\n+```html\n+<input [disabled]=\"condition ? true : false\">\n+<input [attr.disabled]=\"condition ?

When `NgIf` is `false`, Angular removes the element and its descendants from the DOM.\n+It destroys their components, freeing up resources, which\n+results in a better user experience.\n+\n+If you are hiding large component trees, consider `NgIf` as a more\n+efficient alternative to showing/hiding.\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+For more information on `NgIf` and `ngIfElse`, see the [API documentation about NgIf](api/common/NgIf).\n+\n+</div>\n+\n+### Guard against null\n+\n+Another advantage of `ngIf` is that you can use it to guard against null.

In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and has no choice but to replace the old DOM elements with all new DOM elements.\n+\n+You can make this more efficient with `trackBy`.\n+Add a method to the component that returns the value `NgFor` should track.\n+In this case, that value is the hero's `id`. If the `id` has already been rendered,\n+Angular keeps track of it and doesn't re-query the server for the same `id`.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts\" region=\"trackByItems\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+In the microsyntax expression, set `trackBy` to the `trackByItems()` method.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"trackBy\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Here is an illustration of the `trackBy` effect.\n+\"Reset items\" creates new items with the same `item.id`s.\n+\"Change ids\" creates new items with new `item.id`s.\n+\n+* With no `trackBy`, both buttons trigger complete DOM element replacement.\n+* With `trackBy`, only changing the `id` triggers element replacement.\n+\n+<div class=\"lightbox\">\n+  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/built-in-directives/ngfor-trackby.gif\" alt=\"Animation of trackBy\">\n+</div>\n+\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+Built-in directives use only public APIs; that is,\n+they do not have special access to any private APIs that other directives can't access.\n+\n+</div>\n+\n+<hr/>\n+\n+{@a ngSwitch}\n+## The `NgSwitch` directives\n+\n+NgSwitch is like the JavaScript `switch` statement.\n+It displays one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition.\n+Angular puts only the selected element into the DOM.\n+<!-- API Flagged -->\n+`NgSwitch` is actually a set of three, cooperating directives:\n+`NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase`, and `NgSwitchDefault` as in the following example.\n+\n+ <code-example path=\"built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"NgSwitch\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+<div class=\"lightbox\">\n+  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/built-in-directives/ngswitch.gif\" alt=\"Animation of NgSwitch\">\n+</div>\n+\n+`NgSwitch` is the controller directive.

The value for `item` will come from the parent component, which the next section covers.\n+\n+Next, in the child component template, add the following:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/item-detail/item-detail.component.html\" region=\"property-in-template\" header=\"src/app/item-detail/item-detail.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+\n+\n+### In the parent\n+\n+The next step is to bind the property in the parent component's template.\n+In this example, the parent component template is `app.component.html`.\n+\n+First, use the child's selector, here `<app-item-detail>`, as a directive within the\n+parent component template. Then, use [property binding](guide/property-binding)\n+to bind the property in the child to the property of the parent.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"input-parent\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Next, in the parent component class, `app.component.ts`, designate a value for `currentItem`:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/app.component.ts\" region=\"parent-property\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+With `@Input()`, Angular passes the value for `currentItem` to the child so that `item` renders as `Television`.\n+\n+The following diagram shows this structure:\n+\n+<div class=\"lightbox\">\n+  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/inputs-outputs/input-diagram-target-source.svg\" alt=\"Property binding diagram\">\n+</div>\n+\n+The target in the square brackets, `[]`, is the property you decorate\n+with `@Input()` in the child component.

The `EventEmitter` then relays the data to the parent component.\n+\n+First, be sure to import `Output` and `EventEmitter`\n+in the child component class:\n+\n+```js\n+import { Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';\n+\n+```\n+\n+Next, still in the child, decorate a property with `@Output()` in the component class.\n+The following example `@Output()` is called `newItemEvent` and its type is\n+`EventEmitter`, which means it's an event.\n+\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/item-output/item-output.component.ts\" region=\"item-output\" header=\"src/app/item-output/item-output.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+The different parts of the above declaration are as follows:\n+\n+* `@Output()`&mdash;a decorator function marking the property as a way for data to go from the child to the parent\n+* `newItemEvent`&mdash;the name of the `@Output()`\n+* `EventEmitter<string>`&mdash;the `@Output()`'s type\n+* `new EventEmitter<string>()`&mdash;tells Angular to create a new event emitter and that the data it emits is of type string. The type could be any type, such as `number`, `boolean`, and so on. For more information on `EventEmitter`, see the [EventEmitter API documentation](api/core/EventEmitter).\n+\n+Next, create an `addNewItem()` method in the same component class:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/item-output/item-output.component.ts\" region=\"item-output-class\" header=\"src/app/item-output/item-output.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+The `addNewItem()` function uses the `@Output()`, `newItemEvent`,\n+to raise an event in which it emits the value the user\n+types into the `<input>`. In other words, when\n+the user clicks the add button in the UI, the child lets the parent know\n+about the event and gives that data to the parent.\n+\n+### In the child's template\n+\n+The child's template has two controls. The first is an HTML `<input>` with a\n+[template reference variable](guide/template-reference-variables) , `#newItem`,\n+where the user types in an item name. Whatever the user types\n+into the `<input>` gets stored in the `#newItem` variable.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/item-output/item-output.component.html\" region=\"child-output\" header=\"src/app/item-output/item-output.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+The second element is a `<button>`\n+with an [event binding](guide/event-binding). You know it's\n+an event binding because the part to the left of the equal\n+sign is in parentheses, `(click)`.\n+\n+The `(click)` event is bound to the `addNewItem()` method in the child component class which\n+takes as its argument whatever the value of `#newItem` is.\n+\n+Now the child component has an `@Output()`\n+for sending data to the parent and a method for raising an event.\n+The next step is in the parent.\n+\n+## In the parent\n+\n+In this example, the parent component is `AppComponent`, but you could use\n+any component in which you could nest the child.\n+\n+The `AppComponent` in this example features a list of `items`\n+in an array and a method for adding more items to the array.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/app.component.ts\" region=\"add-new-item\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+The `addItem()` method takes an argument in the form of a string\n+and then pushes, or adds, that string to the `items` array.\n+\n+### In the parent's template\n+\n+Next, in the parent's template, bind the parent's\n+method to the child's event. Put the child selector, here `<app-item-output>`,\n+within the parent component's\n+template, `app.component.html`.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"output-parent\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+The event binding, `(newItemEvent)='addItem($event)'`, tells\n+Angular to connect the event in the child, `newItemEvent`, to\n+the method in the parent, `addItem()`, and that the event that the child\n+is notifying the parent about is to be the argument of `addItem()`.\n+In other words, this is where the actual hand off of data takes place.\n+The `$event` contains the data that the user types into the `<input>`\n+in the child template UI.\n+\n+Now, in order to see the `@Output()` working, add the following to the parent's template:\n+\n+```html\n+  <ul>\n+    <li *ngFor=\"let item of items\">{{item}}</li>\n+  </ul>\n+  ```\n+\n+The `*ngFor` iterates over the items in the `items` array. When you enter a value in the child's `<input>` and click the button, the child emits the event and the parent's `addItem()` method pushes the value to the `items` array and it renders in the list.\n+\n+\n+## `@Input()` and `@Output()` together\n+\n+You can use `@Input()` and `@Output()` on the same child component as in the following:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"together\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+The target, `item`, which is an `@Input()` property in the child component class, receives its value from the parent's property, `currentItem`. When you click delete, the child component raises an event, `deleteRequest`, which is the argument for the parent's `crossOffItem()` method.\n+\n+The following diagram is of an `@Input()` and an `@Output()` on the same\n+child component and shows the different parts of each:\n+\n+<div class=\"lightbox\">\n+  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/inputs-outputs/input-output-diagram.svg\" alt=\"Input/Output diagram\">\n+</div>\n+\n+As the diagram shows, use inputs and outputs together in the same manner as using them separately. Here, the child selector is `<app-input-output>` with `item` and `deleteRequest` being `@Input()` and `@Output()`\n+properties in the child component class. The property `currentItem` and the method `crossOffItem()` are both in the parent component class.\n+\n+To combine property and event bindings using the banana-in-a-box\n+syntax, `[()]`, see [Two-way Binding](guide/two-way-binding).\n+\n+## `@Input()` and `@Output()` declarations\n+\n+Instead of using the `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators\n+to declare inputs and outputs, you can identify\n+members in the `inputs` and `outputs` arrays\n+of the directive metadata, as in this example:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/in-the-metadata/in-the-metadata.component.ts\" region=\"metadata\" header=\"src/app/in-the-metadata/in-the-metadata.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+While declaring `inputs` and `outputs` in the `@Directive` and `@Component`\n+metadata is possible, it is a better practice to use the `@Input()` and `@Output()`\n+class decorators instead, as follows:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/input-output/input-output.component.ts\" region=\"input-output\" header=\"src/app/input-output/input-output.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+See the [Decorate input and output properties](guide/styleguide#decorate-input-and-output-properties) section of the\n+[Style Guide](guide/styleguide) for details.\n+\n+\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+If you get a template parse error when trying to use inputs or outputs, but you know that the\n+properties do indeed exist, double check\n+that your properties are annotated with `@Input()` / `@Output()` or that you've declared\n+them in an `inputs`/`outputs` array:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"bash\">\n+Uncaught Error: Template parse errors:\n+Can't bind to 'item' since it isn't a known property of 'app-item-detail'\n+</code-example>\n+\n+</div>\n+\n+{@a aliasing-io}\n+\n+## Aliasing inputs and outputs\n+\n+Sometimes the public name of an input/output property should be different from the internal name. While it is a best practice to avoid this situation, Angular does\n+offer a solution.\n+\n+### Aliasing in the metadata\n+\n+Alias inputs and outputs in the metadata using a colon-delimited (`:`) string with\n+the directive property name on the left and the public alias on the right:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/aliasing/aliasing.component.ts\" region=\"alias\" header=\"src/app/aliasing/aliasing.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+\n+### Aliasing with the `@Input()`/`@Output()` decorator\n+\n+You can specify the alias for the property name by passing the alias name to the `@Input()`/`@Output()` decorator. The internal name remains as usual.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"inputs-outputs/src/app/aliasing/aliasing.component.ts\" region=\"alias-input-output\" header=\"src/app/aliasing/aliasing.component.ts\"></code-example>"

Finally,\n+it assigns this composite interpolated result to an **element or directive property**.\n+\n+You appear to be inserting the result between element tags and assigning it to attributes.\n+However, interpolation is a special syntax that Angular converts into a *property binding*.\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+If you'd like to use something other than `{{` and `}}`, you can\n+configure the interpolation delimiter via the\n+[interpolation](api/core/Component#interpolation)\n+option in the `Component` metadata.\n+\n+</div>\n+\n+## Template expressions\n+\n+A template **expression** produces a value and appears within the double\n+curly braces, `{{ }}`.\n+Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a property of a binding target;\n+the target could be an HTML element, a component, or a directive.\n+\n+The interpolation braces in `{{1 + 1}}` surround the template expression `1 + 1`.\n+In the property binding,\n+a template expression appears in quotes to the right of the&nbsp;`=` symbol as in `[property]=\"expression\"`.\n+\n+In terms of syntax, template expressions are similar to JavaScript.\n+Many JavaScript expressions are legal template expressions, with a few exceptions.\n+\n+You can't use JavaScript expressions that have or promote side effects,\n+including:\n+\n+* Assignments (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `...`)\n+* Operators such as `new`, `typeof`, `instanceof`, etc.\n+* Chaining expressions with <code>;</code> or <code>,</code>\n+* The increment and decrement operators `++` and `--`\n+* Some of the ES2015+ operators\n+\n+Other notable differences from JavaScript syntax include:\n+\n+* No support for the bitwise operators such as `|` and `&`\n+* New [template expression operators](guide/template-expression-operators), such as `|`, `?.` and `!`\n+\n+\n+## Expression context\n+\n+The *expression context* is typically the _component_ instance.\n+In the following snippets, the `recommended` within double curly braces and the\n+`itemImageUrl2` in quotes refer to properties of the `AppComponent`.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"interpolation/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"component-context\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+An expression may also refer to properties of the _template's_ context\n+such as a template input variable,\n+<!-- link to built-in-directives#template-input-variables -->\n+`let customer`, or a template reference variable, `#customerInput`.\n+<!-- link to guide/template-ref-variables -->\n+\n+<code-example path=\"interpolation/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"template-input-variable\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html (template input variable)\"></code-example>\n+\n+<code-example path=\"interpolation/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"template-reference-variable\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html (template reference variable)\"></code-example>\n+\n+The context for terms in an expression is a blend of the _template variables_,\n+the directive's _context_ object (if it has one), and the component's _members_.\n+If you reference a name that belongs to more than one of these namespaces,\n+the template variable name takes precedence, followed by a name in the directive's _context_,\n+and, lastly, the component's member names.\n+\n+The previous example presents such a name collision.

If the expression returns an object, including an `array`, it returns the same object *reference* when called twice in a row.\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+There is one exception to this behavior that applies to `*ngFor`. `*ngFor` has `trackBy` functionality that can deal with referential inequality of objects when iterating over them.

Notice that it's not `colspan`,\n+which is the attribute, spelled with a lowercase `s`.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"colSpan\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+For more details, see the [MDN HTMLTableCellElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableCellElement) documentation.\n+\n+For more information about `colSpan` and `colspan`, see the [Attribute binding](guide/attribute-binding#colspan) guide.\n+\n+Another example is disabling a button when the component says that it `isUnchanged`:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"disabled-button\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Another is setting a property of a directive:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"class-binding\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Yet another is setting the model property of a custom component&mdash;a great way\n+for parent and child components to communicate:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"model-property-binding\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+## Binding targets\n+\n+An element property between enclosing square brackets identifies the target property.\n+The target property in the following code is the image element's `src` property.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"property-binding\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+There's also the `bind-` prefix alternative:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"bind-prefix\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+\n+In most cases, the target name is the name of a property, even\n+when it appears to be the name of an attribute.\n+So in this case, `src` is the name of the `<img>` element property.\n+\n+Element properties may be the more common targets,\n+but Angular looks first to see if the name is a property of a known directive,\n+as it is in the following example:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"class-binding\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Technically, Angular is matching the name to a directive `@Input()`,\n+one of the property names listed in the directive's `inputs` array\n+or a property decorated with `@Input()`.\n+Such inputs map to the directive's own properties.\n+\n+If the name fails to match a property of a known directive or element, Angular reports an “unknown directive” error.\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+Though the target name is usually the name of a property,\n+there is an automatic attribute-to-property mapping in Angular for\n+several common attributes. These include `class`/`className`, `innerHtml`/`innerHTML`, and\n+`tabindex`/`tabIndex`.\n+\n+</div>\n+\n+\n+## Avoid side effects\n+\n+Evaluation of a template expression should have no visible side effects.\n+The expression language itself, or the way you write template expressions,\n+helps to a certain extent;\n+you can't assign a value to anything in a property binding expression\n+nor use the increment and decrement operators.\n+\n+For example, you could have an expression that invoked a property or method that had\n+side effects. The expression could call something like `getFoo()` where only you\n+know what `getFoo()` does. If `getFoo()` changes something\n+and you happen to be binding to that something,\n+Angular may or may not display the changed value. Angular may detect the\n+change and throw a warning error.\n+As a best practice, stick to properties and to methods that return\n+values and avoid side effects.\n+\n+## Return the proper type\n+\n+The template expression should evaluate to the type of value\n+that the target property expects.\n+Return a string if the target property expects a string, a number if it\n+expects a number, an object if it expects an object, and so on.\n+\n+In the following example, the `childItem` property of the `ItemDetailComponent` expects a string, which is exactly what you're sending in the property binding:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"model-property-binding\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+You can confirm this by looking in the `ItemDetailComponent` where the `@Input` type is set to a string:\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/item-detail/item-detail.component.ts\" region=\"input-type\" header=\"src/app/item-detail/item-detail.component.ts (setting the @Input() type)\"></code-example>\n+\n+As you can see here, the `parentItem` in `AppComponent` is a string, which the `ItemDetailComponent` expects:\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts\" region=\"parent-data-type\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+### Passing in an object\n+\n+The previous simple example showed passing in a string. To pass in an object,\n+the syntax and thinking are the same.\n+\n+In this scenario, `ItemListComponent` is nested within `AppComponent` and the `items` property expects an array of objects.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"pass-object\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+The `items` property is declared in the `ItemListComponent` with a type of `Item` and decorated with `@Input()`:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/item-list/item-list.component.ts\" region=\"item-input\" header=\"src/app/item-list.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+In this sample app, an `Item` is an object that has two properties; an `id` and a `name`.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/item.ts\" region=\"item-class\" header=\"src/app/item.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+While a list of items exists in another file, `mock-items.ts`, you can\n+specify a different item in `app.component.ts` so that the new item will render:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts\" region=\"pass-object\" header=\"src/app.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+You just have to make sure, in this case, that you're supplying an array of objects because that's the type of `Item` and is what the nested component, `ItemListComponent`, expects.\n+\n+In this example, `AppComponent` specifies a different `item` object\n+(`currentItems`) and passes it to the nested `ItemListComponent`. `ItemListComponent` was able to use `currentItems` because it matches what an `Item` object is according to `item.ts`. The `item.ts` file is where\n+`ItemListComponent` gets its definition of an `item`.\n+\n+## Remember the brackets\n+\n+The brackets, `[]`, tell Angular to evaluate the template expression.\n+If you omit the brackets, Angular treats the string as a constant\n+and *initializes the target property* with that string:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"no-evaluation\" header=\"src/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+\n+Omitting the brackets will render the string\n+`parentItem`, not the value of `parentItem`.\n+\n+## One-time string initialization\n+\n+You *should* omit the brackets when all of the following are true:\n+\n+* The target property accepts a string value.\n+* The string is a fixed value that you can put directly into the template.\n+* This initial value never changes.\n+\n+You routinely initialize attributes this way in standard HTML, and it works\n+just as well for directive and component property initialization.\n+The following example initializes the `prefix` property of the `StringInitComponent` to a fixed string,\n+not a template expression. Angular sets it and forgets about it.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"string-init\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+The `[item]` binding, on the other hand, remains a live binding to the component's `currentItems` property.\n+\n+## Property binding vs. interpolation\n+\n+You often have a choice between interpolation and property binding.\n+The following binding pairs do the same thing:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"property-binding-interpolation\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Interpolation is a convenient alternative to property binding in\n+many cases. When rendering data values as strings, there is no\n+technical reason to prefer one form to the other, though readability\n+tends to favor interpolation. However, *when setting an element\n+property to a non-string data value, you must use property binding*.\n+\n+## Content security\n+\n+Imagine the following malicious content.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.ts\" region=\"malicious-content\" header=\"src/app/app.component.ts\"></code-example>\n+\n+In the component template, the content might be used with interpolation:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"malicious-interpolated\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Fortunately, Angular data binding is on alert for dangerous HTML. In the above case,\n+the HTML displays as is, and the Javascript does not execute. Angular **does not**\n+allow HTML with script tags to leak into the browser, neither with interpolation\n+nor property binding.\n+\n+In the following example, however, Angular [sanitizes](guide/security#sanitization-and-security-contexts)\n+the values before displaying them.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"property-binding/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"malicious-content\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+Interpolation handles the `<script>` tags differently than\n+property binding but both approaches render the\n+content harmlessly. The following is the browser output\n+of the `evilTitle` examples.\n+\n+<code-example language=\"bash\">\n+\"Template <script>alert(\"evil never sleeps\")</script> Syntax\" is the interpolated evil title.\n+\"Template alert(\"evil never sleeps\")Syntax\" is the property bound evil title.\n+</code-example>"

Here, it protects against a view render failure if `item` is `null`.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"template-expression-operators/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"safe\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+If `item` is `null`, the view still renders but the displayed value is blank; you see only \"The item name is:\" with nothing after it.\n+\n+Consider the next example, with a `nullItem`.\n+\n+<code-example language=\"html\">\n+  The null item name is {{nullItem.name}}\n+</code-example>\n+\n+Since there is no safe navigation operator and `nullItem` is `null`, JavaScript and Angular would throw a `null` reference error and break the rendering process of Angular:\n+\n+<code-example language=\"bash\">\n+  TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null.\n+</code-example>\n+\n+Sometimes however, `null` values in the property\n+path may be OK under certain circumstances,\n+especially when the value starts out null but the data arrives eventually.\n+\n+With the safe navigation operator, `?`, Angular stops evaluating the expression when it hits the first `null` value and renders the view without errors.\n+\n+It works perfectly with long property paths such as `a?.b?.c?.d`.\n+\n+\n+<hr/>\n+\n+{@a non-null-assertion-operator}\n+\n+## The non-null assertion operator ( `!` )\n+\n+As of Typescript 2.0, you can enforce [strict null checking](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html \"Strict null checking in TypeScript\") with the `--strictNullChecks` flag. TypeScript then ensures that no variable is unintentionally `null` or `undefined`.\n+\n+In this mode, typed variables disallow `null` and `undefined` by default. The type checker throws an error if you leave a variable unassigned or try to assign `null` or `undefined` to a variable whose type disallows `null` and `undefined`.\n+\n+The type checker also throws an error if it can't determine whether a variable will be `null` or `undefined` at runtime. You tell the type checker not to throw an error by applying the postfix\n+[non-null assertion operator, !](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#non-null-assertion-operator \"Non-null assertion operator\").\n+\n+The Angular non-null assertion operator, `!`, serves the same purpose in\n+an Angular template. For example, you can assert that `item` properties are also defined.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"template-expression-operators/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"non-null\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+When the Angular compiler turns your template into TypeScript code,\n+it prevents TypeScript from reporting that `item.color` might be `null` or `undefined`.\n+\n+Unlike the [_safe navigation operator_](guide/template-expression-operators#safe-navigation-operator \"Safe navigation operator (?)\"),\n+the non-null assertion operator does not guard against `null` or `undefined`.\n+Rather, it tells the TypeScript type checker to suspend strict `null` checks for a specific property expression.\n+\n+The non-null assertion operator, `!`, is optional with the exception that you must use it when you turn on strict null checks.\n+\n+{@a any-type-cast-function}\n+\n+## The `$any()` type cast function\n+\n+Sometimes a binding expression triggers a type error during [AOT compilation](guide/aot-compiler) and it is not possible or difficult to fully specify the type.\n+To silence the error, you can use the `$any()` cast function to cast\n+the expression to the [`any` type](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#any) as in the following example:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"built-in-template-functions/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"any-type-cast-function-1\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+When the Angular compiler turns this template into TypeScript code,\n+it prevents TypeScript from reporting that `bestByDate` is not a member of the `item`\n+object when it runs type checking on the template.\n+\n+The `$any()` cast function also works with `this` to allow access to undeclared members of\n+the component.\n+\n+<code-example path=\"built-in-template-functions/src/app/app.component.html\" region=\"any-type-cast-function-2\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+The `$any()` cast function works anywhere in a binding expression where a method call is valid.\n+"
