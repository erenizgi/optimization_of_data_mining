    "message": "test(forms): verify that an object is not a boxed value if only `disabled` field is present (#39801)\n\nThe value of a `FormControl` is treated in a special way (called boxed values) when it's an object with exactly\n2 fields: `value` and `disabled`. This commit adds a test which verifies that an object is not treated as a boxed\nvalue when `disabled` field is present, but `value` is missing.\n\nPR Close #39801",
