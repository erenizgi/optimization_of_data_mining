We currently also have a limit, meaning the bot will process\nonly 50 feature requests before it exits. Additionally, now the bot will\nnot close issues, it'll just comment on them and if they have an\ninsufficient number of votes, the bot will label them with `insufficient\nvotes`.\n\nOn the next iteration, we can:\n- Expand the limit from 50 to infinity (removing the option from the\nyml file)\n- Set a cron configuration to kick off the bot automatically\n- Enable autoclose by setting the `close-when-no-sufficient-votes` to\n`true`\n\nPR Close #41975",
