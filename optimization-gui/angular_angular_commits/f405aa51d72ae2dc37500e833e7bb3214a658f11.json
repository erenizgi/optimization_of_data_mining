See [PR 38931](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38931).\n+* TypeScript 3.9 is no longer supported. Please update to TypeScript 4.0. See [PR 39313](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39313).\n+* `NavigationExtras#preserveQueryParams` has been removed from `@angular/router`. See [PR 38762](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38762)\n+* `CollectionChangeRecord` has been removed from `@angular/core`. See [PR 38668](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38668).\n+* We changed the default value for `relativeLinkResolution` from `'legacy'` to `'corrected'` so that new applications are automatically opted-in to the corrected behavior from  [PR 22394](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/22394). Applications which use the current default are updated by a migration to specify `'legacy'` to ensure the current behavior is maintained when the default is updated. See [PR 25609](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/25609).\n+* Fixed a bug in the router where the arguments for `future` and `curr` snapshots were reversed in the call to `shouldReuseRoute` when processing child routes. Usually this ordering mistake doesn't matter because most implementations of [`shouldReuseRoute`](api/router/RouteReuseStrategy#shouldReuseRoute) just do\n+an equality comparison between `future` and `curr`. However, some implementations actually do rely on values specifically on\n+one of the two and will need to be updated. See [PR 26949](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/26949).\n+* `ViewEncapsulation.Native` has been removed. Angular previously supported a view encapsulation mode `ViewEncapsulaion.Native` that was based on the v0 Shadow DOM Draft APIs. These APIs have been superceded by the final Shadow DOM APIs, which are enabled via `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom`. For background information about this change, see [Web Components update: more time to upgrade to v1 APIs](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/07/web-components-time-to-upgrade).\n+* `@angular/platform-webworker` has been removed and will no longer be supported. See [PR 38846](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38846).\n+* `@angular/platform-webworker` is no longer supported. No further versions will be published. See [PR 38846](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38846).\n+* Updated the options for `initialNavigation`. For more information, see [initialNavigation](api/router/InitialNavigation) in the API documentation. See [PR 33128](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33128).\n+* `DatePipe` no longer rounds up fractional milliseconds. See [PR 38009](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38009).\n+* Locale data arrays are now read-only. See [PR 30397](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30397).\n+* The injected `ControlValueAccessor` for `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` is now readonly. See [PR 29273](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29723).\n+* The type of `AbstractControl#parent` now indicates that it may be null. See [PR 32671](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32671).\n+* Calling `overrideProvider` before initializing the TestBed will now throw an error. See [PR 38717](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38717).\n+* Types for many Angular built-in pipes have been either narrowed or expanded to be more accurate. For more information, see the corresponding [Pipes](https://angular.io/api?type=pipe) API documentation. See [PR 37447](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37447).\n+* Directives in the `@angular/forms` package used to have `any[]` as a type of validators and asyncValidators\n+arguments in constructors. Now these arguments are properly typed, so if your code relies on\n+directive constructor types it may require some updates to improve type safety. See [PR 38994](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38944).\n+* `routerLink` now accepts `undefined` inputs. See [PR 39151](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39151).\n+* The `async` function from `@angular/core/testing` has been renamed to `waitForAsync` in order to avoid confusion with the native JavaScript `async` syntax.
