In the previous section, the product data and the `share()` method in the component class handle data and functionality, respectively.\n-* **An HTML template** that determines the UI. In the previous section, the product list's HTML template displays the name, description, and a \"Share\" button for each product.\n-* **Component-specific styles** that define the look and feel.\n-Though product list does not define any styles, this is where component CSS\n-resides.\n-\n-<!--\n-### Class definition\n-\n-Let's take a quick look a the product list component's class definition:\n-\n-1. In the `product-list` directory, open `product-list.component.ts`.\n+In editing the template, you have explored some of the most popular features of Angular templates.\n+For more information, see [Introduction to components and templates](guide/architecture-components#template-syntax \"Template Syntax\").\n \n-1. Notice the `@Component` decorator. This provides metadata about the component, including its templates, styles, and a selector.\n+{@a passing-data-in}\n \n-    * The `selector` is used to identify the component. The selector is the name you give the Angular component when it is rendered as an HTML element on the page. By convention, Angular component selectors begin with the prefix such as `app-`, followed by the component name.\n-\n-    * The template and style filename also are provided here. By convention each of the component's parts is in a separate file, all in the same directory and with the same prefix.\n-\n-1. The component definition also includes an exported class, which handles functionality for the component. This is where the product list data and `Share()` method are defined.\n-\n-### Composition\n--->\n-\n-An Angular application comprises a tree of components, in which each Angular component has a specific purpose and responsibility.\n-\n-Currently, the example app has three components:\n-\n-<div class=\"lightbox\">\n-  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/start/app-components.png\" alt=\"Online store with three components\">\n-</div>\n-\n-* `app-root` (orange box) is the application shell.

Create a new product alerts component.\n+This section walks you through creating a child component, `ProductAlertsComponent` that can receive data from its parent component, `ProductListComponent`.\n \n-    1. Right click on the `app` folder and use the `Angular Generator` to generate a new component named `product-alerts`.\n+1. Right click on the `app` folder and use the `Angular Generator` to generate a new component named `product-alerts`.\n \n-        <div class=\"lightbox\">\n-          <img src=\"generated/images/guide/start/generate-component.png\" alt=\"StackBlitz command to generate component\">\n-        </div>\n+  <div class=\"lightbox\">\n+    <img src=\"generated/images/guide/start/generate-component.png\" alt=\"StackBlitz command to generate component\">\n+  </div>\n \n-        The generator creates starter files for all three parts of the component:\n-        * `product-alerts.component.ts`\n-        * `product-alerts.component.html`\n-        * `product-alerts.component.css`\n+    The generator creates starter files for the three parts of the component:\n+    * `product-alerts.component.ts`\n+    * `product-alerts.component.html`\n+    * `product-alerts.component.css`\n \n 1.
