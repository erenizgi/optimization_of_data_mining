Built Angular applications are very portable and can live in any environment or served by any technology, such as Node, Java, .NET, PHP, and many others.\n+This section builds on the previous steps in the [Getting Started](start \"Try it: A basic application\") tutorial and shows you how to deploy your application.\n \n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+## Prerequisites\n \n-Whether you came here directly from [Part 1](start \"Try it: A basic app\"), or completed the entire online store application through the [In-app navigation](start/start-routing \"Try it: In-app navigation\"), [Manage data](start/start-data \"Try it: Manage data\"), and [Forms for user input](start/start-forms \"Try it: Forms for user input\") sections, you have an application that you can deploy by following the instructions in this section.\n+A best practice is to run your project locally before you deploy it. To run your project locally, you need the following installed on your computer:\n \n-</div>\n+* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n+* The [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).\n+    From the terminal, install the Angular CLI globally with:\n \n-## Share your application\n+    ```sh\n+    npm install -g @angular/cli\n+    ```\n \n-StackBlitz projects are public by default, allowing you to share your Angular app via the project URL. Keep in mind that this is a great way to share ideas and prototypes, but it is not intended for production hosting.\n+    With the Angular CLI, you can use the command `ng` to create new workspaces, new projects, serve your application during development, or produce builds to share or distribute.\n \n-1. In your StackBlitz project, make sure you have forked or saved your project.\n-1. In the preview page, you should see a URL that looks like `https://<Project ID>.stackblitz.io`.\n-1. Share this URL with a friend or colleague.\n-1. Users that visit your URL will see a development server start up, and then your application will load.\n+## Running your application locally\n \n-## Building locally\n+1. Download the source code from your StackBlitz project by clicking the `Download Project` icon in the left menu, across from `Project`, to download your files.\n \n-To build your application locally or for production, download the source code from your StackBlitz project by clicking the `Download Project` icon in the left menu across from `Project` to download your files.\n+1. Create a new Angular CLI workspace using the [`ng new`](cli/new \"CLI ng new command reference\") command, where `my-project-name` is what you would like to call your project:\n \n-Once you have the source code downloaded and unzipped, install `Node.js` and serve your app with the Angular CLI.\n+    ```sh\n+    ng new my-project-name\n+    ```\n \n-From the terminal, install the Angular CLI globally with:\n+1. In your newly CLI-generated application, replace the `/src` folder with the `/src` folder from your `StackBlitz` download.\n \n-```sh\n-npm install -g @angular/cli\n-```\n+1. Use the following CLI command to run your application locally:\n \n-This installs the command `ng` on your system, which is the command you use to create new workspaces, new projects, serve your application during development, or produce builds to share or distribute.\n+    ```sh\n+    ng serve\n+    ```\n \n-Create a new Angular CLI workspace using the [`ng new`](cli/new \"CLI ng new command reference\") command:\n+1. To see your application in the  browser, go to http://localhost:4200/.\n+    If the default port 4200 is not available, you can specify another port with the port flag as in the following example:\n \n-```sh\n-ng new my-project-name\n-```\n+     ```sh\n+    ng serve --port 4201\n+    ```\n \n-In your new CLI generated app, replace the `/src` folder with the one from your `StackBlitz` download, and then perform a build.\n+    While serving your application, you can edit your code and see the changes update automatically in the browser.\n+    To stop the `ng serve` command, press `Ctrl`+`c`.\n \n-```sh\n-ng build --prod\n-```\n+{@a building}\n+## Building and hosting your application\n \n-This will produce the files that you need to deploy.\n+ 1. To build your application for production, use the `build` command with the `prod` flag.\n \n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+    ```sh\n+    ng build --prod\n+    ```\n \n-If the above `ng build` command throws an error about missing packages, append the missing dependencies in your local project's `package.json` file to match the one in the downloaded StackBlitz project.\n+    This command creates a `dist` folder in the application root directory with all the files that a hosting service needs for serving your application.\n \n-</div>\n+    <div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n \n-#### Hosting the built project\n+    If the above `ng build` command throws an error about missing packages, append the missing dependencies in your local project's `package.json` file to match the one in the downloaded StackBlitz project.\n \n-The files in the `dist/my-project-name` folder are static. This means you can host them on any web server capable of serving files (such as `Node.js`, Java, .NET), or any backend (such as Firebase, Google Cloud, or App Engine).\n+    </div>\n \n-### Hosting an Angular app on Firebase\n+1. Copy the contents of the `dist/my-project-name` folder to your web server.\n+    Because these files are static, you can host them on any web server capable of serving files; such as `Node.js`, Java, .NET, or any backend such as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting), or [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/getting-started/hosting-a-static-website).\n+    For more information, see [Building & Serving](guide/build \"Building and Serving Angular Apps\") and [Deployment](guide/deployment \"Deployment guide\").\n \n-One of the easiest ways to get your site live is to host it using Firebase.\n+<hr />\n \n-1. Sign up for a firebase account on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/ \"Firebase web site\").\n-1. Create a new project, giving it any name you like.\n-1. Add the `@angular/fire` schematics that will handle your deployment using `ng add @angular/fire`.\n-1. Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) globally using `npm install -g firebase-tools`.\n-1. Connect your CLI to your Firebase account and initialize the connection to your project using `firebase login` and `firebase init`.\n-1. Follow the prompts to select the `Firebase` project you are creating for hosting.\n-    - Select the `Hosting` option on the first prompt.\n-    - Select the project you previously created on Firebase.\n-    - Select `dist/my-project-name` as the public directory.\n-1. Deploy your application with `ng deploy`.\n-1. Once deployed, visit https://your-firebase-project-name.firebaseapp.com to see it live!\n+## What's next\n \n-### Hosting an Angular app anywhere else\n+In this tutorial, you've laid the foundation to explore the Angular world in areas such as mobile development, UX/UI development, and server-side rendering.\n+You can go deeper by studying more of Angular's features, engaging with the vibrant community, and exploring the robust ecosystem.\n \n-To host an Angular app on another web host, upload or send the files to the host.\n-Because you are building a single page application, you'll also need to make sure you redirect any invalid URLs to your `index.html` file.\n-Read more about development and distribution of your application in the [Building & Serving](guide/build \"Building and Serving Angular Apps\") and [Deployment](guide/deployment \"Deployment guide\") guides.\n+### Learning more Angular\n \n-## Join the Angular community\n+For a more in-depth tutorial that leads you through building an application locally and exploring many of Angular's most popular features, see [Tour of Heroes](tutorial).\n \n-You are now an Angular developer!
