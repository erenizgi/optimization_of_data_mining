As part of this project we’ll investigate what are the blockers to move forward with this effort and take the steps forward to enable it.\n+To simplify the Angular mental model and learning journey, we’ll be working on making NgModules optional. This work lets developers develop standalone components and implement an alternative API for declaring the component’s compilation scope.
