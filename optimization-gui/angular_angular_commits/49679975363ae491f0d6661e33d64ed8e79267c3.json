    "message": "ci(compiler-cli): exempt compiler-cli .bazel files from dev-infra approval (#37558)\n\nPreviously, dev-infra approval (via PullApprove) was required for all\n.bazel files in the monorepo, including those in packages/compiler-cli.\n\nThe compiler-cli package is a little special in this sense:\n * it's not shipped to NPM in the APF\n * it uses lots of internal subpackages to organize and test its code\n\nAs a result:\n * changes to compiler-cli BUILD.bazel files are not user visible and\n   don't have larger implications for the packages published to NPM,\n   unlike changes to other BUILD.bazel files in the repo\n * the requirement for dev-infra approval for BUILD.bazel changes is\n   overly burdensome, because compiler-cli build files change more\n   rapidly than those of other packages.\n\nThis commit exempts the compiler-cli's build files from the requirement\nfor dev-infra approval. It will be sufficient for such files to be\napproved by the normal compiler reviewers.\n\nPR Close #37558",
