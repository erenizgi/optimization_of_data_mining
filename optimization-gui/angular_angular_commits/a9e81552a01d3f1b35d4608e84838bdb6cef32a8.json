It will show all the defined routes that are currently loaded in the application.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/router-tree.png\" />\n+\n+The routes shows the path to each component (think view). The `AppComponent` path is the root `/`. AppComponent loads two `[lazy]` loaded routes `/` and `/demo-app`. Hovering over each route will display additional details about the route.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/router.gif\" />\n+\n+Additional details about a specific route is displayed when hoovering over the routes.\n+\n+- _Name_: name of the component used to render the route. If route is being lazy loaded just path name is displayed.\n+- _Path_: actual path for the route being used within the application.\n+- _Auxiliary Route_: if the route is an auxiliary route or not.\n+\n+### Enabling Router Tree\n+\n+To be able to view the router tree, you will need to inject the Router in the application _Root_ component as shown below (it must be named `router` exactly).\n+\n+```typescript\n+export class AppComponent {\n+  constructor(public router: Router) {}\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Detecting Routes\n+\n+The way Angular Devtools detects the name of a route is through:\n+\n+1. Checking if a component is connected to the route. If so, use the name of that component\n+2. If there is no component, Devtools checks if it's a _lazy route_, if so it will specify the name as `path + [Lazy]`, example `demo-app [Lazy]`\n+3. If there is no component and it's not a _lazy route_. Devtools will check if it's a redirect route, if it is - Devtools will return `path -> redirecting to -> redirectPath`.\n+4. If none of the above matches, Augury will return `no-name-route`, ideally this shouldn't happen."
