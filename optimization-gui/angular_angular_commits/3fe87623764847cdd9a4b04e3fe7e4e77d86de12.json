    "message": "docs: clarify location.subscribe behavior (#42272)\n\n`Location.go` does not trigger the browser's `popstate` event because\nthe Angular Router uses `pushState` and `replaceState`. This can be\nconfusing when calling `Location.go` and using `Location.subscribe`.\nThis commit clarifies the behavior of `Location.subscribe` and points\ndevelopers to the `onUrlChanges` subscription instead.\n\nFixes #12691\n\nPR Close #42272",
