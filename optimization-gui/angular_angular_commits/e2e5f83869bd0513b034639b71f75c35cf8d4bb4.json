    "message": "ci: update payload size limits for Closure tests (#38411)\n\nCurrently the Closure-related tests are not tree-shaking the dev-mode-only content, thus payload\nsize checks are failing even if dev-mode-only content is added.\nThe https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/2e9fdbde9eb26fea17e3e68e272dc1c2cc9f4fa3 commit\nadded some logic to JIT compiler, which is likely triggered the payload size increase. This commit\nupdates the payload size limits for Closure-related test to get master and patch branches back to\nthe \"green\" state.\n\nPR Close #38411",
