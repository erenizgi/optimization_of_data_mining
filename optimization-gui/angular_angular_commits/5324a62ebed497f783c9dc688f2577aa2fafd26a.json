Before reading, you should understand\n+[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200).\n+\n+## Distribution tags on npm\n+\n+Angular's branching relates directly to versions published on npm. We will reference these [npm\n+distribution tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-dist-tag#purpose) throughout:\n+\n+| Tag    | Description                                                                       |\n+|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| latest | The most recent stable version.                                                   |\n+| next   | The most recent pre-release version of Angular for testing. May not always exist. |\n+| v*-lts | The most recent LTS release for the specified version, such as `v9-lts`.          |\n+\n+## Branch naming\n+\n+Angular's main branch is `master`. This branch always represents the absolute latest changes. The\n+code on master always represents a pre-release version, often published with the `next` tag on npm.\n+\n+For each minor and major version increment, a new branch is created. These branches use a naming\n+scheme matching `\\d+\\.\\d+\\.x` and receive subsequent patch changes for that version range. For\n+example, the `10.2.x` branch represents the latest patch changes for subsequent releases starting\n+with `10.2.`. The version tagged on npm as `latest` will always correspond to such a branch,\n+referred to as the **active patch branch**.\n+\n+## Major releases lifecycle\n+\n+Angular releases a major version roughly every six months. Following a major release, we move\n+through a consistent lifecycle to the next major release, and repeat. At a high level, this\n+process proceeds as follows:\n+\n+* A major release occurs. The `master` branch now represents the next minor version.\n+* Six weeks later, a minor release occurs. The `master` branch now represents the next minor\n+  version.\n+* Six weeks later, a second minor release occurs. The `master` branch now represents the next major\n+  version.\n+* Three months later, a major release occurs and the process repeats.\n+\n+### Example\n+* Angular publishes `11.0.0`. At this point in time, the `master` branch represents `11.1.0`.\n+* Six weeks later, we publish `11.1.0` and `master` represents `11.2.0`.\n+* Six weeks later, we publish `11.2.0` and `master` represents `12.0.0`.\n+* Three months later, this cycle repeats with the publication of `12.0.0`.\n+\n+### Feature freeze and release candidates\n+\n+Before publishing minor and major versions as `latest` on npm, they go through a feature freeze and\n+a release candidate (RC) phase.\n+\n+**Feature freeze** means that `master` is forked into a branch for a specific version, with no\n+additional features permitted before releasing as `latest` to npm. This branch becomes the **active\n+RC branch**. Upon branching, the `master` branch increments to the next minor or major pre-release\n+version. One week after feature freeze, the first RC is published with the `next` tag on npm from\n+the active RC branch. Patch bug fixes continue to merge into `master`, the active RC branch, and\n+the active patch branch during this entire period.\n+\n+One to three weeks after publishing the first RC, the active RC branch is published as `latest` on\n+npm and the branch becomes the active patch branch. At this point there is no active RC branch until\n+the next minor or major release.\n+\n+## Targeting pull requests\n+\n+Every pull request has a **base branch**:\n+\n+![Screenshot of a GitHub PR with the base branch highlighted](./images/pr-base-branch-screenshot.png)\n+\n+This base branch represents the latest branch that will receive the change. Most pull requests\n+should specify `master`. However, some changes will explicitly use an earlier branch, such as\n+`11.1.x`, in order to patch an older version. Specific GitHub labels, described below, control the\n+additional branches into which a pull request will be cherry-picked.\n+\n+### Labelling pull requests\n+\n+There are five labels that target PRs to versions:\n+ \n+| Label         | Description                                                                 |\n+|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| target: major | A change that includes a backwards-incompatible behavior or API change.     |\n+| target: minor | A change that introduces a new, backwards-compatible functionality.         |\n+| target: patch | A backwards-compatible bug fix.                                             |\n+| target: rc    | A change that should be explicitly included in an active release candidate. |\n+| target: lts   | A critical security or browser compatibility fix for LTS releases.          |\n+\n+Every PR must have exactly one `target: *` label. Angular's dev tooling will merge the pull request\n+into its base branch and then cherry-pick the commits to the appropriate branches based on the\n+specified target label.\n+\n+The vast majority of pull requests will target `major`, `minor`, or `patch` based on the contents of\n+the code change. In rare cases, a pull request will specify `target: rc` or `target: lts` to\n+explicitly target a special branch.\n+\n+Breaking changes, marked with `target: major`, can only be merged when `master` represents the next\n+major version.\n+\n+### Pull request examples\n+\n+| I want to...                                                | Target branch           | Target label | Your change will land in...                                                                                                  |\n+|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| Make a non-breaking bug fix                                 | `master`                | `patch`      | `master`, the active patch branch, and the active RC branch if there is one                                                  |\n+| Introduce a new feature                                     | `master`                | `minor`      | `master` (any time)                                                                                                          |\n+| Make a breaking change                                      | `master`                | `major`      | `master` (only when `master` represents the next major version)                                                              |\n+| Make a critical security fix                                | `master`                | `lts`        | `master`, the active patch branch, the active RC branch if there is one, and all branches for versions within the LTS window |\n+| Bump the version of an RC                                   | the active RC branch    | `rc`         | The active RC branch                                                                                                         |\n+| Fix an RC bug for a major release feature                   | `master`                | `rc`         | `master` and the active RC branch                                                                                            |\n+| Backport a bug fix to the `latest` npm version during an RC | the active patch branch | `patch`      | the active patch branch only                                                                                                 |"
