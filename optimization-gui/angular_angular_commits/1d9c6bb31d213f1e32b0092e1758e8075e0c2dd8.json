Currently, a `light` and a `dark` theme are supported.\n+See also [#41129](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41129) for more details/discussions around the theming implementation.\n+\n+\n+## Styles for theming\n+\n+Styles for each area/component are split between two files: `<name>.scss` and `<name>-theme.scss`.\n+\n+The general styles go into `<name>.scss`.\n+If an area/component has styles that could change based on the active theme (such as color or background), these go into the `*-theme.scss` file.\n+Color-related styles in particular should always go into that file, even if the styles do not currently change between themes.\n+This will make it easier to adjust/add more themes in the future.\n+\n+Within each `*-theme.scss` file is a Sass mixin that takes in a Material theme configuration and generates the appropriate styling for that theme and component.\n+\n+Advantages of the chosen approach:\n+- Theming is contained to one file per component.\n+  Developers need only be aware of the existence of a single file when making theming related changes to a component\n+- Themes can be lazy-loaded at runtime, preventing growth of the default styles chunk every time a new theme is implemented.\n+\n+Disadvantages of the chosen approach:\n+- Splitting styles into two files means that some selectors will be duplicated, resulting in an increase of the total styles chunk size.\n+\n+\n+## Applying a theme at runtime\n+\n+When building the app the following styles bundles are generated:\n+- One [based on `main.scss`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/62b5a6cb079e489d91982abe88d644d73feb73f3/aio/angular.json#L44), which is always included in `index.html` and contains the general (non-theme-specific) styles.\n+- [One bundle per theme](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/62b5a6cb079e489d91982abe88d644d73feb73f3/aio/angular.json#L45-L54), which is loaded \"on demand\" and contains theme-specific styles.\n+\n+A theme bundle is [loaded at runtime](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/62b5a6cb079e489d91982abe88d644d73feb73f3/aio/src/index.html#L33-L36) using the CSS [`@import` rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import).\n+The appropriate theme is chosen based on the user's preference (either through an operating system setting or a user agent setting) using the [`prefers-color-scheme` media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).\n+\n+Once the application has bootstrapped, the theme [may be updated](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/62b5a6cb079e489d91982abe88d644d73feb73f3/aio/src/app/shared/theme-picker/theme-toggle.component.ts#L49-L72) based on a previously stored application-specific preference.\n+Whenever the user explicitly changes the theme using the theme-toggle component, the new preference [is stored](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/62b5a6cb079e489d91982abe88d644d73feb73f3/aio/src/app/shared/theme-picker/theme-toggle.component.ts#L89) for use in future visits.\n+\n+> **NOTE:**<br />\n+> The theming infrastructure is based on the [material.angular.io](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io) implementation."
