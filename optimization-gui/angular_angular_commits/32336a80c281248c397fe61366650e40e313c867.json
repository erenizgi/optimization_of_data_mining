    "message": "refactor(core): fix rollup bundle issues due to re-export conflicts (#43431)\n\nAfter updating to a more recent version of rollup, rollup started to\ncomplain because the `inject` and `ɵɵinject` functions are being re-exported\ntwice in the `@angular/core` public API entry-point.\n\nRollup threw errors like:\n\n```\n[!] Error: “ɵɵinject” cannot be exported from node_modules/@angular/core/esm2015/src/di/injector_compatibility.js as it is a reexport that references itself.\n\n```\n\nA similar error is shown for `CodegenComponentFactoryResolver`.\n\nIt seems like Rollup ideally would not throw here, similar to TypeScript\nwhich detects that these exports are the same and just dedupes them, but\nit's low-effort fixing this for now.\n\nPR Close #43431",
