Now those methods return functions that can be called\n+to remove event handlers.\n+* **core:** The type of the `APP_INITIALIZER` token has been changed to more accurately\n+reflect the types of return values that are handled by Angular. Previously,\n+each initializer callback was typed to return `any`, this is now\n+`Promise<unknown> | Observable<unknown> | void`. In the unlikely event that\n+your application uses the `Injector.get` or `TestBed.inject` API to inject\n+the `APP_INITIALIZER` token, you may need to update the code to account for\n+the stricter type.\n+\n+Additionally, TypeScript may report the TS2742 error if the `APP_INITIALIZER`\n+token is used in an expression of which its inferred type has to be emitted\n+into a .d.ts file. To workaround this, an explicit type annotation is needed,\n+which would typically be `Provider` or `Provider[]`.\n+\n+\n+\n ## 11.2.5 (2021-03-10)\n \n "
