    "message": "build: enable code splitting for esbuild bundling of compiler-cli (#43932)\n\nEnables code spitting for ESBuild bundling of the compiler-cli. When\nwe initially configured ESBuild as part of APF v13, we left this option\ndisabled as code splitting is marked experimental. The ESM splitting\nmechanism in ESBuild seems very solid so far (judging subjectively\nand by experience/reports in the ESBuild repo), so we should give\nit a shot, in order to significantly reduce the size of the NPM package,\nand simplify debugging (by not having duplicated code portions for all\nthe different entry points).\n\nTo clarify: Code splitting is helpful as we have multiple entry-points\nthat currently duplicate code. With code splitting these entry-points\nwould share common code instead.\n\nPR Close #43932",
