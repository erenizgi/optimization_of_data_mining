After we triage a ticket and we identify it as a feature request, it goes\n+through several steps.\n+\n+## Manual review\n+\n+First, we manually review to verify if it aligns with any of the existing roadmap efforts. If it\n+does, we prioritize it. Alternatively, we keep it open and our feature request bot initiates a\n+voting process.\n+\n+## Voting phase\n+\n+To include the community in the feature request process, we open voting for 60 days. Anyone can cast\n+a vote for the request with a thump-up (👍) reaction. If the feature request reaches 20 or more\n+upvotes, we review it again manually. Alternatively, the bot closes the request.\n+\n+## Consideration phase\n+\n+If the feature request receives 20 or more votes, we verify if we can afford to maintain it and\n+whether it aligns with the long-term vision of Angular. If the answers of both questions are yes,\n+we prioritize the request, alternatively we close it.\n+\n+## Diagram\n+\n+![Feature Request Automation](https://github.com/angular/angular/raw/master/docs/images/feature-request-automation.png)\n+\n+## What if I want to implement the feature to help the Angular team?\n+\n+Often implementing the feature as an separate package is a better option. Building an external\n+package rather than including the functionality in Angular helps with:\n+\n+- Keeping the framework's runtime smaller and simpler\n+- Makes the learning journey of developers getting started with Angular smoother\n+- Reduces maintainers burden and the complexity of the source code"
