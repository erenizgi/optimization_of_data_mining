    "message": "fix(docs-infra): fix sidenav top position on narrow screens (#40802)\n\nOn larger screens the top-bar has a height of 64px. On screens smaller\nthan 600px, the top-bar has a height of 56px. As a result, the sidenav\nshould have a top position of 56px on screens smaller than 600px and\n64px on other screens.\n\nPreviously, the style setting the top position to 56px was tied to the\npresence of the `.collapsed` class, which depends on whether the sidenav\nis docked or not. The change from docked to collapsed sidenav, however,\nhappens at 992px. As a result, the sidenav had an incorrect top position\n(56px instead of 64px) on screens between 600px and 991px.\n\nThis commit fixes this by ensuring the change of the top position for\nthe sidenav happens at 600px.\n\nPR Close #40802",
