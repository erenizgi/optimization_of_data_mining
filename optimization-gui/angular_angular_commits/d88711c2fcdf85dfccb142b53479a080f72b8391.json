    "message": "docs: add Ivy and View Engine test scripts (#38149)\n\nDeveloper docs previously stated to use `yarn bazel test //packages/...` which attempts to test all packages with View\nEngine (the default), even though not all support View Engine. This updates the doc to use `yarn test-ivy-aot` and\n`yarn test-non-ivy` which tests both Ivy and View Engine while filtering out tests which are not compatible with each\nrenderer.\n\nPR Close #38149",
