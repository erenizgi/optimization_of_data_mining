See [PR 38931](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38931).\n-* TypeScript 3.9 is no longer supported. Please update to TypeScript 4.0. See [PR 39313](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39313).\n-* `NavigationExtras#preserveQueryParams` has been removed from `@angular/router`. See [PR 38762](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38762)\n-* `CollectionChangeRecord` has been removed from `@angular/core`. See [PR 38668](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38668).\n-* We changed the default value for `relativeLinkResolution` from `'legacy'` to `'corrected'` so that new applications are automatically opted-in to the corrected behavior from  [PR 22394](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/22394). Applications which use the current default are updated by a migration to specify `'legacy'` to ensure the current behavior is maintained when the default is updated. See [PR 25609](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/25609).\n-* Fixed a bug in the router where the arguments for `future` and `curr` snapshots were reversed in the call to `shouldReuseRoute` when processing child routes. Usually this ordering mistake doesn't matter because most implementations of [`shouldReuseRoute`](api/router/RouteReuseStrategy#shouldReuseRoute) just do\n-an equality comparison between `future` and `curr`. However, some implementations actually do rely on values specifically on\n-one of the two and will need to be updated. See [PR 26949](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/26949).\n-* `ViewEncapsulation.Native` has been removed. Angular previously supported a view encapsulation mode `ViewEncapsulaion.Native` that was based on the v0 Shadow DOM Draft APIs. These APIs have been superceded by the final Shadow DOM APIs, which are enabled via `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom`. For background information about this change, see [Web Components update: more time to upgrade to v1 APIs](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/07/web-components-time-to-upgrade).\n-* `@angular/platform-webworker` has been removed and will no longer be supported. See [PR 38846](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38846).\n-* `@angular/platform-webworker` is no longer supported. No further versions will be published. See [PR 38846](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38846).\n-* Updated the options for `initialNavigation`. For more information, see [initialNavigation](api/router/InitialNavigation) in the API documentation. See [PR 33128](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33128).\n-* `DatePipe` no longer rounds up fractional milliseconds. See [PR 38009](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38009).\n-* Locale data arrays are now read-only. See [PR 30397](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30397).\n-* The injected `ControlValueAccessor` for `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` is now readonly. See [PR 29273](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29723).\n-* The type of `AbstractControl#parent` now indicates that it may be null. See [PR 32671](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32671).\n-* Calling `overrideProvider` before initializing the TestBed will now throw an error. See [PR 38717](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38717).\n-* Types for many Angular built-in pipes have been either narrowed or expanded to be more accurate. For more information, see the corresponding [Pipes](https://angular.io/api?type=pipe) API documentation. See [PR 37447](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37447).\n-* Directives in the `@angular/forms` package used to have `any[]` as a type of validators and asyncValidators\n-arguments in constructors. Now these arguments are properly typed, so if your code relies on\n-directive constructor types it may require some updates to improve type safety. See [PR 38994](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/38944).\n-* `routerLink` now accepts `undefined` inputs. See [PR 39151](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39151).\n-* The `async` function from `@angular/core/testing` has been renamed to `waitForAsync` in order to avoid confusion with the native JavaScript `async` syntax. The existing function is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. See [PR 37583](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37583).\n-\n-{@a deprecations}\n-### New Deprecations\n-\n-| Area                          | API or Feature                                     | May be removed in |\n-| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n-| `@angular/core/testing`       | Rename `async` to `waitForAsync`                       | <!--v11--> v13 |\n-\n-\n-{@a removals}\n-### New Removals of Deprecated APIs\n-\n-The following APIs have been removed starting with version 11.0.0*:\n-\n-| Package          | API            | Replacement | Notes |\n-| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----- |\n-| `@angular/router`| `NavigationExtras#preserveQueryParams` | no action needed | NavigationExtras#preserveQueryParams has been removed from `@angular/router`.|\n-| `@angular/core` | `CollectionChangeRecord` | no action needed | CollectionChangeRecord has been removed from `@angular/core`.|\n-| `@angular/core` | `ViewEncapsulation.Native` | no action needed | Angular previously supported a view encapsulation mode `ViewEncapsulaion.Native` that was based on the v0 Shadow DOM Draft APIs.

Instead, applications must use the [`sass` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass), or the [`sass-embedded` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-embedded) for the `sass-embedded` beta.\n+* The Angular tooling now uses Webpack 5 to build applications. Webpack 4 usage and support has been removed.\n+  You don't need to make any project level configuration changes to use the upgraded Webpack version when using the official Angular builders.\n+  Custom builders based on this package that use the experimental programmatic APIs may need to be updated to become compatible with Webpack 5.\n+  See [PR #20466](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466).\n+* Webpack 5 generates similar but differently named files for lazy-loaded JavaScript files in development configurations when the `namedChunks` option is enabled.\n+  For the majority of users this change should have no effect on the application or build process.\n+  Production builds should also not be affected as the `namedChunks` option is disabled by default in production configurations.\n+  However, if a project's post-build process makes assumptions as to the file names, then adjustments may need to be made to account for the new naming paradigm.\n+  Such post-build processes could include custom file transformations after the build, integration into service-side frameworks, or deployment procedures.\n+  An example of a development file name change is `lazy-lazy-module.js` becoming `src_app_lazy_lazy_module_ts.js`.\n+  See [PR #20466](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466).\n+* Webpack 5 now includes web worker support.\n+  However, the structure of the URL within the worker constructor must be in a specific format that differs from the current requirement.\n+  To update web worker usage, where `./app.worker` is the actual worker name, change `new Worker('./app.worker', ...)` to `new Worker(new URL('./app.worker', import.meta.url), ...)`.\n+  See [PR #20466](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20466).\n+* Critical CSS inlining is now enabled by default.\n+  To turn this off, set `inlineCritical` to false.\n+  See [PR #20096](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20096) and the [Style preprocessor options](guide/workspace-config#optimization-configuration) section of [Angular workspace configuration](guide/workspace-config).\n+* `ng build` now produces production bundle by default.\n+  See [PR #20128](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/20128).\n+* Previously, the Forms module ignored `min` and `max` attributes defined on the `<input type=\"number\">`.\n+  Now these attributes trigger `min` and `max` validation logic in cases where `formControl`, `formControlName`, or `ngModel` directives are also present on a given input.\n+  See [PR #39063](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/39063).\n+\n+\n+{@a deprecations}\n+### New deprecations\n+\n+* Support for Internet Explorer 11 is deprecated.\n+  See [Deprecated APIs and features](guide/deprecations) and [Microsoft 365 apps say farewell to Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 sunsets Microsoft Edge Legacy](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666).\n+* Sass imports from `@angular/material/theming` are deprecated. There is a new Angular Material Sass API for `@use`.\n+  Run the migration script `ng g @angular/material:themingApi` to switch all your Sass imports for Angular CDK and Angular Material to the new API and `@use`.\n+* Support for publishing libraries with View Engine has been deprecated:\n+  - You can now compile libraries in [_partial_ compilation mode](guide/angular-compiler-options#compilationmode) to generate Ivy compatible output that will be _linked_ when an application using that library is bundled.\n+  - New libraries you create with the Angular CLI default to partial compilation mode, and do not support View Engine. You can still build a library with View Engine. See [Creating libraries](guide/creating-libraries) for more information.\n+  - Libraries compiled in partial compilation mode will not contain legacy `i18n` message IDs.\n+    If the library was previously compiled by View Engine, and contained legacy `i18n` message IDs, then applications may have translation files that you'll need to migrate to the new message ID format.
