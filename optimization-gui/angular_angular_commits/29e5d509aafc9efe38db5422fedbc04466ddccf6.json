    "message": "docs: clarify expectations for `ActivatedRoute` observables (#42316)\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/16261#issuecomment-748289240\n\nA couple important things to note about the behavior:\n\n* The component is destroyed, meaning that all of its members will be destroyed as well, including any subscriptions to the route params\n* This _does not_ mean that any `finalize` operators or `complete` on the subscription is called. This only happens if the source completes or you unsubscribe from the subscription. The documentation doesn't state that the `Router` will do this, though I can still understand why the behavior is confusing.\n\nYou can play around with these scenarios here:\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-hmpizx\n* `complete` the source without unsubscribe: `next`, `complete` and `finalize` are all called, even when `complete` is called before the `next` from the `delay`\n* `unsubscribe` from subscription without `complete` on the source: `finalize` happens, but the `complete` of the subscription does not, and neither does `next`\n\nSo even if the `Router` were to call `complete` on all of the `Observables` on an `ActivatedRoute`, you would see that any subscriptions with a `delay` operator would still get called.\n\nresolves #16261\n\nPR Close #42316",
