Use it to store items such as page titles, breadcrumb text, and other read-only, static data.\n+You can use the [resolve guard](guide/router-tutorial-toh#resolve-guard) to retrieve dynamic data.\n+\n+The empty path in the fourth route represents the default path for the application&mdash;the place to go when the path in the URL is empty, as it typically is at the start.\n+This default route redirects to the route for the `/heroes` URL and, therefore, displays the `HeroesListComponent`.\n+\n+If you need to see what events are happening during the navigation lifecycle, there is the `enableTracing` option as part of the router's default configuration.\n+This outputs each router event that took place during each navigation lifecycle to the browser console.\n+Use `enableTracing` only for debugging purposes.\n+You set the `enableTracing: true` option in the object passed as the second argument to the `RouterModule.forRoot()` method.\n+\n+{@a basics-router-outlet}\n+\n+### Router outlet\n+\n+The `RouterOutlet` is a directive from the router library that is used like a component.\n+It acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should\n+display the components for that outlet.\n+\n+<code-example language=\"html\">\n+  &lt;router-outlet>&lt;/router-outlet>\n+  &lt;!-- Routed components go here -->\n+\n+</code-example>\n+\n+Given the configuration above, when the browser URL for this application becomes `/heroes`, the router matches that URL to the route path `/heroes` and displays the `HeroListComponent` as a sibling element to the `RouterOutlet` that you've placed in the host component's template.\n+\n+{@a basics-router-links}\n+\n+{@a router-link}\n+\n+### Router links\n+\n+To navigate as a result of some user action such as the click of an anchor tag, use `RouterLink`.\n+\n+Consider the following template:\n+\n+<code-example path=\"router/src/app/app.component.1.html\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n+\n+The `RouterLink` directives on the anchor tags give the router control over those elements.\n+The navigation paths are fixed, so you can assign a string to the `routerLink` (a \"one-time\" binding).\n+\n+Had the navigation path been more dynamic, you could have bound to a template expression that returned an array of route link parameters; that is, the [link parameters array](guide/router#link-parameters-array).\n+The router resolves that array into a complete URL.\n+\n+{@a router-link-active}\n+\n+### Active router links\n+\n+The `RouterLinkActive` directive toggles CSS classes for active `RouterLink` bindings based on the current `RouterState`.\n+\n+On each anchor tag, you see a [property binding](guide/property-binding) to the `RouterLinkActive` directive that looks like `routerLinkActive=\"...\"`.\n+\n+The template expression to the right of the equal sign, `=`, contains a space-delimited string of CSS classes that the Router adds when this link is active (and removes when the link is inactive).\n+You set the `RouterLinkActive` directive to a string of classes such as `[routerLinkActive]=\"'active fluffy'\"` or bind it to a component property that returns such a string.\n+\n+Active route links cascade down through each level of the route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time.\n+To override this behavior, you can bind to the `[routerLinkActiveOptions]` input binding with the `{ exact: true }` expression. By using `{ exact: true }`, a given `RouterLink` will only be active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.\n+\n+{@a basics-router-state}\n+\n+### Router state\n+\n+After the end of each successful navigation lifecycle, the router builds a tree of `ActivatedRoute` objects that make up the current state of the router. You can access the current `RouterState` from anywhere in the application using the `Router` service and the `routerState` property.\n+\n+Each `ActivatedRoute` in the `RouterState` provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child, and sibling routes.\n+\n+{@a activated-route}\n+\n+### Activated route\n+\n+The route path and parameters are available through an injected router service called the [ActivatedRoute](api/router/ActivatedRoute).\n+It has a great deal of useful information including:\n+\n+<table>\n+  <tr>\n+    <th>\n+      Property\n+    </th>\n+\n+    <th>\n+      Description\n+    </th>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>url</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    An `Observable` of the route path(s), represented as an array of strings for each part of the route path.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>data</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    An `Observable` that contains the `data` object provided for the route.\n+    Also contains any resolved values from the [resolve guard](guide/router-tutorial-toh#resolve-guard).\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>paramMap</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    An `Observable` that contains a [map](api/router/ParamMap) of the required and [optional parameters](guide/router-tutorial-toh#optional-route-parameters) specific to the route.\n+    The map supports retrieving single and multiple values from the same parameter.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>queryParamMap</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    An `Observable` that contains a [map](api/router/ParamMap) of the [query parameters](guide/router-tutorial-toh#query-parameters) available to all routes.\n+    The map supports retrieving single and multiple values from the query parameter.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>fragment</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    An `Observable` of the URL [fragment](guide/router-tutorial-toh#fragment) available to all routes.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>outlet</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    The name of the `RouterOutlet` used to render the route.\n+    For an unnamed outlet, the outlet name is primary.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>routeConfig</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    The route configuration used for the route that contains the origin path.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+    <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>parent</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    The route's parent `ActivatedRoute` when this route is a [child route](guide/router-tutorial-toh#child-routing-component).\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>firstChild</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    Contains the first `ActivatedRoute` in the list of this route's child routes.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+\n+  <tr>\n+    <td>\n+      <code>children</code>\n+    </td>\n+    <td>\n+\n+    Contains all the [child routes](guide/router-tutorial-toh#child-routing-component) activated under the current route.\n+\n+    </td>\n+  </tr>\n+</table>\n+\n+<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n+\n+Two older properties are still available; however, their replacements are preferable as they may be deprecated in a future Angular version.\n+\n+* `params`: An `Observable` that contains the required and [optional parameters](guide/router-tutorial-toh#optional-route-parameters) specific to the route.

Use it to store items such as page titles, breadcrumb text, and other read-only, static data.\n-You can use the [resolve guard](guide/router-tutorial-toh#resolve-guard) to retrieve dynamic data.\n-\n-The empty path in the fourth route represents the default path for the application&mdash;the place to go when the path in the URL is empty, as it typically is at the start.\n-This default route redirects to the route for the `/heroes` URL and, therefore, displays the `HeroesListComponent`.\n-\n-If you need to see what events are happening during the navigation lifecycle, there is the `enableTracing` option as part of the router's default configuration.\n-This outputs each router event that took place during each navigation lifecycle to the browser console.\n-Use `enableTracing` only for debugging purposes.\n-You set the `enableTracing: true` option in the object passed as the second argument to the `RouterModule.forRoot()` method.\n-\n-{@a basics-router-outlet}\n-\n-### Router outlet\n-\n-The `RouterOutlet` is a directive from the router library that is used like a component.\n-It acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should\n-display the components for that outlet.\n-\n-<code-example language=\"html\">\n-  &lt;router-outlet>&lt;/router-outlet>\n-  &lt;!-- Routed components go here -->\n-\n-</code-example>\n-\n-Given the configuration above, when the browser URL for this application becomes `/heroes`, the router matches that URL to the route path `/heroes` and displays the `HeroListComponent` as a sibling element to the `RouterOutlet` that you've placed in the host component's template.\n-\n-{@a basics-router-links}\n-\n-{@a router-link}\n-\n-### Router links\n-\n-To navigate as a result of some user action such as the click of an anchor tag, use `RouterLink`.\n-\n-Consider the following template:\n-\n-<code-example path=\"router/src/app/app.component.1.html\" header=\"src/app/app.component.html\"></code-example>\n-\n-The `RouterLink` directives on the anchor tags give the router control over those elements.\n-The navigation paths are fixed, so you can assign a string to the `routerLink` (a \"one-time\" binding).\n-\n-Had the navigation path been more dynamic, you could have bound to a template expression that returned an array of route link parameters; that is, the [link parameters array](guide/router#link-parameters-array).\n-The router resolves that array into a complete URL.\n-\n-{@a router-link-active}\n-\n-### Active router links\n-\n-The `RouterLinkActive` directive toggles CSS classes for active `RouterLink` bindings based on the current `RouterState`.\n-\n-On each anchor tag, you see a [property binding](guide/property-binding) to the `RouterLinkActive` directive that looks like `routerLinkActive=\"...\"`.\n-\n-The template expression to the right of the equal sign, `=`, contains a space-delimited string of CSS classes that the Router adds when this link is active (and removes when the link is inactive).\n-You set the `RouterLinkActive` directive to a string of classes such as `[routerLinkActive]=\"'active fluffy'\"` or bind it to a component property that returns such a string.\n-\n-Active route links cascade down through each level of the route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time.\n-To override this behavior, you can bind to the `[routerLinkActiveOptions]` input binding with the `{ exact: true }` expression. By using `{ exact: true }`, a given `RouterLink` will only be active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.\n-\n-{@a basics-router-state}\n-\n-### Router state\n-\n-After the end of each successful navigation lifecycle, the router builds a tree of `ActivatedRoute` objects that make up the current state of the router. You can access the current `RouterState` from anywhere in the application using the `Router` service and the `routerState` property.\n-\n-Each `ActivatedRoute` in the `RouterState` provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child and sibling routes.\n-\n-{@a activated-route}\n-\n-### Activated route\n-\n-The route path and parameters are available through an injected router service called the [ActivatedRoute](api/router/ActivatedRoute).\n-It has a great deal of useful information including:\n-\n-<table>\n-  <tr>\n-    <th>\n-      Property\n-    </th>\n-\n-    <th>\n-      Description\n-    </th>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>url</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    An `Observable` of the route path(s), represented as an array of strings for each part of the route path.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>data</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    An `Observable` that contains the `data` object provided for the route.\n-    Also contains any resolved values from the [resolve guard](guide/router-tutorial-toh#resolve-guard).\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>paramMap</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    An `Observable` that contains a [map](api/router/ParamMap) of the required and [optional parameters](guide/router-tutorial-toh#optional-route-parameters) specific to the route.\n-    The map supports retrieving single and multiple values from the same parameter.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>queryParamMap</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    An `Observable` that contains a [map](api/router/ParamMap) of the [query parameters](guide/router-tutorial-toh#query-parameters) available to all routes.\n-    The map supports retrieving single and multiple values from the query parameter.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>fragment</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    An `Observable` of the URL [fragment](guide/router-tutorial-toh#fragment) available to all routes.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>outlet</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    The name of the `RouterOutlet` used to render the route.\n-    For an unnamed outlet, the outlet name is primary.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>routeConfig</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    The route configuration used for the route that contains the origin path.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-    <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>parent</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    The route's parent `ActivatedRoute` when this route is a [child route](guide/router-tutorial-toh#child-routing-component).\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>firstChild</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    Contains the first `ActivatedRoute` in the list of this route's child routes.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-\n-  <tr>\n-    <td>\n-      <code>children</code>\n-    </td>\n-    <td>\n-\n-    Contains all the [child routes](guide/router-tutorial-toh#child-routing-component) activated under the current route.\n-\n-    </td>\n-  </tr>\n-</table>\n-\n-<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n-\n-Two older properties are still available, however, their replacements are preferable as they may be deprecated in a future Angular version.\n-\n-* `params`: An `Observable` that contains the required and [optional parameters](guide/router-tutorial-toh#optional-route-parameters) specific to the route.
