Your filter does not introduce any HTML-unsafe characters (``<``, ``>``,\n-       ``'``, ``\"`` or ``&``) into the result that were not already present.

If you're *removing* characters, you might inadvertently leave\n-       unbalanced HTML tags or entities in the result. For example, removing a\n-       ``>`` from the input might turn ``<a>`` into ``<a``, which would need to\n-       be escaped on output to avoid causing problems. Similarly, removing a\n-       semicolon (``;``) can turn ``&amp;`` into ``&amp``, which is no longer a\n-       valid entity and thus needs further escaping.

(In the latter\n-       case, we just use the identity function as the \"escape\" function.) The\n-       ``conditional_escape()`` function is like ``escape()`` except it only\n-       escapes input that is **not** a ``SafeData`` instance. If a ``SafeData``\n-       instance is passed to ``conditional_escape()``, the data is returned\n-       unchanged.\n-\n-       Finally, in the above example, we remember to mark the result as safe\n-       so that our HTML is inserted directly into the template without further\n-       escaping.\n-\n-       There's no need to worry about the ``is_safe`` attribute in this case\n-       (although including it wouldn't hurt anything).

This attribute\n+   tells Django that your filter function wants to be passed an extra\n+   keyword argument, called ``autoescape``, that is ``True`` if\n+   auto-escaping is in effect and ``False`` otherwise.\n+\n+   For example, let's write a filter that emphasizes the first character of\n+   a string:\n+\n+   .. code-block:: python\n+\n+       from django.utils.html import conditional_escape\n+       from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n+\n+       def initial_letter_filter(text, autoescape=None):\n+           first, other = text[0], text[1:]\n+           if autoescape:\n+               esc = conditional_escape\n+           else:\n+               esc = lambda x: x\n+           result = '<strong>%s</strong>%s' % (esc(first), esc(other))\n+           return mark_safe(result)\n+       initial_letter_filter.needs_autoescape = True\n+\n+   The ``needs_autoescape`` attribute on the filter function and the\n+   ``autoescape`` keyword argument mean that our function will know whether\n+   automatic escaping is in effect when the filter is called. We use\n+   ``autoescape`` to decide whether the input data needs to be passed\n+   through ``django.utils.html.conditional_escape`` or not. (In the latter\n+   case, we just use the identity function as the \"escape\" function.) The\n+   ``conditional_escape()`` function is like ``escape()`` except it only\n+   escapes input that is **not** a ``SafeData`` instance. If a ``SafeData``\n+   instance is passed to ``conditional_escape()``, the data is returned\n+   unchanged.\n+\n+   Finally, in the above example, we remember to mark the result as safe\n+   so that our HTML is inserted directly into the template without further\n+   escaping.\n+\n+   There's no need to worry about the ``is_safe`` attribute in this case\n+   (although including it wouldn't hurt anything). Whenever you manually\n+   handle the auto-escaping issues and return a safe string, the\n+   ``is_safe`` attribute won't change anything either way.\n \n Writing custom template tags\n ----------------------------\n@@ -381,37 +381,37 @@ object:\n \n Notes:\n \n-    * ``parser`` is the template parser object.
