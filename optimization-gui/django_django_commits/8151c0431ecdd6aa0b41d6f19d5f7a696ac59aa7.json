Django 1.2.5 is a recommended upgrade for any\n+development or deployment currently using or targeting Django 1.2.\n+\n+For full details on the new features, backwards incompatibilities, and\n+deprecated features in the 1.2 branch, see the :doc:`/releases/1.2`.\n+\n+Backwards incompatible changes\n+==============================\n+\n+FileField no longer deletes files\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+In earlier Django versions, when a model instance containing a\n+:class:`~django.db.models.FileField` was deleted,\n+:class:`~django.db.models.FileField` took it upon itself to also delete the\n+file from the backend storage. This opened the door to several potentially\n+serious data-loss scenarios, including rolled-back transactions and fields on\n+different models referencing the same file. In Django 1.2.5,\n+:class:`~django.db.models.FileField` will never delete files from the backend\n+storage. If you need cleanup of orphaned files, you'll need to handle it\n+yourself (for instance, with a custom management command that can be run\n+manually or scheduled to run periodically via e.g. cron).\n+\n+Use of custom SQL to load initial data in tests\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django provides a custom SQL hooks as a way to inject hand-crafted SQL\n+into the database synchronization process. One of the possible uses\n+for this custom SQL is to insert data into your database. If your\n+custom SQL contains ``INSERT`` statements, those insertions will be\n+performed every time your database is synchronized. This includes the\n+synchronization of any test databases that are created when you run a\n+test suite.\n+\n+However, in the process of testing the Django 1.3, it was discovered\n+that this feature has never completely worked as advertised. When\n+using database backends that don't support transactions, or when using\n+a TransactionTestCase, data that has been inserted using custom SQL\n+will not be visible during the testing process.\n+\n+Unfortunately, there was no way to rectify this problem without\n+introducing a backwards incompatibility. Rather than leave\n+SQL-inserted initial data in an uncertain state, Django now enforces\n+the policy that data inserted by custom SQL will *not* be visible\n+during testing.\n+\n+This change only affects the testing process. You can still use custom\n+SQL to load data into your production database as part of the syncdb\n+process. If you require data to exist during test conditions, you\n+should either insert it using :ref:`test fixtures\n+<topics-testing-fixtures>`, or using the ``setUp()`` method of your\n+test case."
