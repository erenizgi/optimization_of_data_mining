When committing a pull request, make sure each individual\n+commit matches the commit guidelines described below. Contributors are\n+expected to provide the best pull requests possible. However, in practice,\n+committers are more familiar with the commit guidelines, and they may have to\n+rewrite the commit history.\n+\n+Here is one way to commit a pull request::\n+\n+    # Create a new branch tracking upstream/master -- upstream is assumed\n+    # to be django/django.\n+    git checkout -b pull_xxxx upstream/master\n+\n+    # Download the patches from github and apply them.\n+    curl https://github.com/django/django/pull/XXXX.patch | git am\n+\n+At this point, you can work on the code. Use ``git rebase -i`` and ``git\n+commit --amend`` to make sure the commits have the expected level of quality.\n+Once you're ready::\n+\n+    # Make sure master is ready to receive changes.\n+    git checkout master\n+    git pull upstream master\n+    # Merge the work as \"fast-forward\" to master, to avoid a merge commit.\n+    git merge --ff-only pull_xx\n+    # Check that only the changes you expect will be pushed to upstream.\n+    git push --dry-run upstream master\n+    # Push!\n+    git push upstream master\n+\n+    # Get rid of the pull_xxxx branch.\n+    git branch -d pull_xxxx\n+\n+An alternative is to add the contributor's repository as a new remote, do a\n+checkout of the branch and work from there::\n+\n+    git remote add <contributor> https://github.com/<contributor>/django.git\n+    git checkout pull_xxxx <contributor> <contributor's pull request branch>\n+\n+At this point, you can work on the code and continue as above.\n+\n+GitHub provides a one-click merge functionality for pull requests. This should\n+only be used if the pull request is 100% ready, and you have checked it for\n+errors (or trust the request maker enough to skip checks).

Neither the\n+  tests nor the docs should emit warnings.\n+\n+* Trivial and small patches usually are best done in one commit.

People should be able to run\n-production sites against the trunk at any time. Additionally, commits to trunk\n-ought to be as atomic as possible -- smaller changes are better. Thus, large\n-feature changes -- that is, changes too large to be encapsulated in a single\n-patch, or changes that need multiple eyes on them -- must happen on dedicated\n-branches.\n-\n-This means that if you want to work on a large feature -- anything that would\n-take more than a single patch, or requires large-scale refactoring -- you need\n-to do it on a feature branch. Our development process recognizes two options\n-for feature branches:\n-\n-1. Feature branches using a distributed revision control system like\n-   Git_, Mercurial_, Bazaar_, etc.\n-\n-   If you're familiar with one of these tools, this is probably your best\n-   option since it doesn't require any support or buy-in from the Django\n-   core developers.\n-\n-   However, do keep in mind that Django will continue to use Subversion\n-   for the foreseeable future, and this will naturally limit the\n-   recognition of your branch. Further, if your branch becomes eligible\n-   for merging to trunk you'll need to find a core developer familiar\n-   with your DVCS of choice who'll actually perform the merge.\n-\n-   If you do decided to start a distributed branch of Django and choose to\n-   make it public, please add the branch to the `Django branches`_ wiki\n-   page.\n-\n-2. Feature branches using SVN have a higher bar. If you want a branch\n-   in SVN itself, you'll need a \"mentor\" among the :doc:`core committers\n-   </internals/committers>`. This person is responsible for actually\n-   creating the branch, monitoring your process (see below), and\n-   ultimately merging the branch into trunk.\n-\n-   If you want a feature branch in SVN, you'll need to ask in\n-   `django-developers`_ for a mentor.\n-\n-.. _git: http://git-scm.com/\n-.. _mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/\n-.. _bazaar: http://bazaar.canonical.com/\n-.. _django branches: https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoBranches\n-\n-Branch rules\n-------------\n-\n-We've got a few rules for branches born out of experience with what makes a\n-successful Django branch.\n-\n-DVCS branches are obviously not under central control, so we have no way of\n-enforcing these rules. However, if you're using a DVCS, following these rules\n-will give you the best chance of having a successful branch (read: merged back\n-to trunk).\n-\n-Developers with branches in SVN, however, **must** follow these rules. The\n-branch mentor will keep on eye on the branch and **will delete it** if these\n-rules are broken.\n-\n-* Only branch entire copies of the Django tree, even if work is only\n-  happening on part of that tree. This makes it painless to switch to a\n-  branch.\n-\n-* Merge changes from trunk no less than once a week, and preferably every\n-  couple-three days.\n-\n-  In our experience, doing regular trunk merges is often the difference\n-  between a successful branch and one that fizzles and dies.\n-\n-  If you're working on an SVN branch, you should be using `svnmerge.py`_\n-  to track merges from trunk.\n-\n-* Keep tests passing and documentation up-to-date. As with patches,\n-  we'll only merge a branch that comes with tests and documentation.\n-\n-.. _svnmerge.py: http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py\n-\n-Once the branch is stable and ready to be merged into the trunk, alert\n-`django-developers`_.\n-\n-After a branch has been merged, it should be considered \"dead\"; write access\n-to it will be disabled, and old branches will be periodically \"trimmed.\"\n-To keep our SVN wrangling to a minimum, we won't be merging from a given\n-branch into the trunk more than once.\n-\n-Using branches\n---------------\n-\n-To use a branch, you'll need to do two things:\n-\n-* Get the branch's code through Subversion.\n-\n-* Point your Python ``site-packages`` directory at the branch's version of\n-  the ``django`` package rather than the version you already have\n-  installed.\n-\n-Getting the code from Subversion\n-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n-\n-To get the latest version of a branch's code, check it out using Subversion:\n-\n-.. code-block:: bash\n-\n-    svn co https://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/<branch>/\n-\n-...where ``<branch>`` is the branch's name. See the `list of branch names`_.\n-\n-Alternatively, you can automatically convert an existing directory of the\n-Django source code as long as you've checked it out via Subversion. To do the\n-conversion, execute this command from within your ``django`` directory:\n-\n-.. code-block:: bash\n-\n-    svn switch https://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/<branch>/\n-\n-The advantage of using ``svn switch`` instead of ``svn co`` is that the\n-``switch`` command retains any changes you might have made to your local copy\n-of the code. It attempts to merge those changes into the \"switched\" code. The\n-disadvantage is that it may cause conflicts with your local changes if the\n-\"switched\" code has altered the same lines of code.\n-\n-(Note that if you use ``svn switch``, you don't need to point Python at the\n-new version, as explained in the next section.)\n-\n-.. _list of branch names: https://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/branches\n-\n-.. _pointing-python-at-the-new-django-version:\n-\n-Pointing Python at the new Django version\n-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n-\n-Once you've retrieved the branch's code, you'll need to change your Python\n-``site-packages`` directory so that it points to the branch version of the\n-``django`` directory. (The ``site-packages`` directory is somewhere such as\n-``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages`` or\n-``/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`` or ``C:\\Python\\site-packages``.)\n-\n-The simplest way to do this is by renaming the old ``django`` directory to\n-``django.OLD`` and moving the trunk version of the code into the directory\n-and calling it ``django``.\n-\n-Alternatively, you can use a symlink called ``django`` that points to the\n-location of the branch's ``django`` package. If you want to switch back, just\n-change the symlink to point to the old code.\n-\n-A third option is to use a path file (``<something>.pth``). This is a feature of\n-the :mod:`site` module. First, make sure there are no files, directories or\n-symlinks named ``django`` in your ``site-packages`` directory. Then create a\n-text file named ``django.pth`` and save it to your ``site-packages`` directory.\n-That file should contain a path to your copy of Django on a single line and\n-optional comments. Here is an example that points to multiple branches. Just\n-uncomment the line for the branch you want to use ('trunk' in this example) and\n-make sure all other lines are commented::\n-\n-    # Trunk is a svn checkout of:\n-    #   https://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/\n-    #\n-    /path/to/trunk\n-\n-    # <branch> is a svn checkout of:\n-    #   https://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/<branch>/\n-    #\n-    #/path/to/<branch>\n-\n-    # On windows a path may look like this:\n-    # C:/path/to/<branch>\n-\n-.. _django-developers: http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers"

You can `download\n+<http://git-scm.com/download>`_ Git, but it's often easier to install with\n+your operating system's package manager.\n+\n+Django's `Git repository`_ is hosted on `GitHub`_, and it is recommended\n+that you also work using GitHub.\n+\n+After installing Git the first thing you should do is setup your name and\n+email::\n+\n+  $ git config --global user.name \"Firstname Lastname\"\n+  $ git config --global user.email \"your_email@youremail.com\"\n+\n+Note that ``user.name`` should be your real name, not your GitHub nick. GitHub\n+should know the email you use in the ``user.email`` field, as this will be\n+used to associate your commits with your GitHub account.\n+\n+Now we are going to show how to create a GitHub pull request containing the\n+changes for Trac ticket #xxxxx. By creating a fully ready pull request you\n+will make the committers' job easier, and thus your work is more likely to be\n+merged into Django. You can also upload a traditional patch to Trac, but it's\n+less practical for reviews.\n+\n+.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/\n+.. _GitHub: https://github.com/\n+.. _Git repository: https://github.com/django/django/\n+\n+Setting up local repository\n+---------------------------\n+\n+When you have created a GitHub account, with the nick \"github_nick\", and\n+forked Django's repository, you should create a local copy of your fork::\n+\n+    git clone git@github.com:github_nick/django.git\n+\n+This will create a new directory \"django\" containing a clone of your GitHub\n+repository. Your GitHub repository will be called \"origin\" in Git. You should\n+also setup django/django as an \"upstream\" remote::\n+\n+    git remote add upstream git@github.com:django/django.git\n+    git fetch upstream\n+\n+You can add other remotes similarly, for example::\n+\n+    git remote add akaariai git@github.com:akaariai/django.git\n+\n+Working on a ticket\n+-------------------\n+\n+When working on a ticket you will almost always want to create a new branch\n+for the work, and base that work on upstream/master::\n+\n+    git checkout -b ticket_xxxxx upstream/master\n+\n+If you are working for a fix on the 1.4 branch, you would instead do::\n+\n+    git checkout -b ticket_xxxxx_1_4 upstream/stable/1.4.x\n+\n+Assume the work is carried on ticket_xxxxx branch. Make some changes and\n+commit them::\n+\n+    git commit\n+\n+When writing the commit message, you should follow the :ref:`commit message\n+guidelines <committing-guidlines>` to ease the work of the committer. If\n+you're uncomfortable with English, try at least to describe precisely what the\n+commit does.\n+\n+If you need to do additional work on your branch, commit as often as\n+necessary::\n+\n+    git commit -m 'Added two more tests for edge cases'\n+\n+Publishing work\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+You can publish your work on GitHub by just using::\n+\n+  git push origin ticket_xxxxx\n+\n+When you go to your GitHub page you will notice a new branch has been created.\n+If you are working on a Trac ticket, you should mention in the ticket that\n+your work is available from branch ticket_xxxxx of your github repo. Include a\n+link to your branch.\n+\n+Note that the above branch is called a \"topic branch\" in Git parlance. This\n+means that other people should not base their work on your branch. In\n+particular this means you are free to rewrite the history of this branch (by\n+using ``git rebase`` for example). There are also \"public branches\". These are\n+branches other people are supposed to fork, and thus their history should\n+never change. Good examples of public branches are the ``master`` and\n+``stable/A.B.x`` branches in the django/django repository.\n+\n+When you think your work is ready to be pulled into Django, you should create\n+a pull request at GitHub. A good pull request contains:\n+\n+* Commits with one logical change in each, following the\n+  :doc:`coding style <coding-style>`.\n+\n+* Well formed messages for each commit: a summary line and then paragraphs\n+  wrapped at 72 characters thereafter. See the :ref:`committing guidelines\n+  <committing-guidlines>` for more details.\n+\n+* Documentation and tests, if needed. Actually tests are always needed, except\n+  for documentation changes.\n+\n+* The test suite passes and the documentation builds without warnings.\n+\n+Once you have created your pull request, you should add a comment in the\n+related Trac ticket explaining what you've done. In particular you should tell\n+in which environment you've run the tests, for instance: \"all tests pass under\n+SQLite and MySQL\".\n+\n+Your pull request should be ready for merging into Django. Pull requests at\n+GitHub have only two states: open and closed. The committers who deals with\n+your pull request has only two options: merge it or close it. For this reason,\n+it isn't useful to make a pull request until the code is ready for merging --\n+or sufficiently close that a committer will finish it himself.\n+\n+Rebasing branches\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+In the example above you created two commits, the \"Fixed ticket_xxxxx\" commit\n+and \"Added two more tests\" commit. We do not want to have the \"Added two more\n+tests\" commit in the Django's repository as it would just be useless noise.\n+Instead, we would like to only have one commit. To rework the history of your\n+branch you can squash the commits into one by using interactive rebase::\n+\n+    git rebase -i HEAD~2\n+\n+The HEAD~2 above is shorthand for two latest commits. The above command\n+will open an editor showing the two commits, prefixed with the word \"pick\".\n+You should change the second line to \"squash\" instead. This will keep the\n+first commit, and squash the second commit to the first one. Save and quit\n+the editor. A second editor window should open. Here you can reword the\n+commit message for the commit.\n+\n+You can also use the \"edit\" option in rebase. This way you can change a single\n+commit. For example::\n+\n+    git rebase -i HEAD~3\n+    # Choose edit, pick, pick for the commits\n+    # Now you are able to rework the commit (use git add normally to add changes)\n+    # When finished, commit work with \"--amend\" and continue\n+    git commit --amend\n+    # reword the commit message if needed\n+    git rebase --continue\n+    # The second and third commit should be applied.\n+\n+If you need to change an already published topic branch at GitHub, you will\n+need to force-push the changes::\n+\n+    git push -f origin ticket_xxxxx\n+\n+Note that this will rewrite history of ticket_xxxxx - if you check the commit\n+hashes before and after the operation at GitHub you will notice that the\n+commit hashes do not match any more. This is acceptable, as the branch is topic\n+branch, and nobody should be basing their work on this branch.\n+\n+After upstream has changed\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+When upstream (django/django) has changed, you should rebase your work. To\n+do this, use::\n+\n+  git fetch upstream\n+  git rebase\n+\n+The work is automatically rebased using the branch you forked on, in the\n+example case using upstream/master.\n+\n+The rebase command removes all your local commits temporarily, applies the\n+upstream commits, and then applies your local commits again on the work. If\n+there are merge conflicts you will need to resolve them and then use ``git\n+rebase --continue``. At any point you can use ``git rebase --abort`` to return\n+to the original state.\n+\n+Note that you want to rebase on upstream, not merge the upstream. The reason\n+for this is that by rebasing, your commits will always be on top of the\n+upstream's work, not mixed with the changes in the upstream. This way your\n+branch only contains commits related to its topic, and this makes squashing\n+easier.\n+\n+After review\n+------------\n+\n+It is unusual to get any non-trivial amount of code into core without changes\n+requested by reviewers. In this case, it is often a good idea to add the\n+changes as one incremental commit to your work. This allows the reviewer to\n+easily check what changes you have done::\n+\n+  # Do changes required by the reviewer, commit often.\n+  # Before publishing the changes, rebase your work. Assume you added two\n+  # commits to the work.\n+  git rebase -i HEAD~2\n+  # squash the second commit into the first, write a commit message something\n+  # like this:\n+  Made changes asked in review by the_reviewer\n+\n+    - Fixed whitespace errors in foo/bar\n+    - Reworded the doc string of the_method()\n+\n+  # Push your work back to your github repo, there should not be any need\n+  # for force (-f) push, as you didn't touch the public commits in the rebase.\n+  git push origin ticket_xxxxx\n+  # Check your pull request, it should now contain the new commit, too.\n+\n+The committer is likely to squash the review commit into the previous commit\n+when committing the code.\n+\n+Summary\n+-------\n+\n+* Work on GitHub if possible.\n+* Announce your work on the Trac ticket by linking to your GitHub branch.\n+* When you have something ready, make a pull request.\n+* Make your pull requests as good as you can.\n+* When doing fixes to your work, use ``git rebase -i`` to squash the commits.\n+* When upstream has changed, do ``git fetch upstream; git rebase``."

This document covers the way the code\n+repository is laid out and how to work with and find things in it.\n+\n+.. _an official packaged release of Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/\n+\n+High-level overview\n+===================\n+\n+The Django source code repository uses `Git`_ to track changes to the code\n+over time, so you'll need a copy of the Git client (a program called ``git``)\n+on your computer, and you'll want to familiarize yourself with the basics of\n+how Git works. Git's web site offers downloads for various operating systems.\n+The site contains also vast amounts of `documentation`_.\n+\n+The Django Git repository is located online at `github.com/django/django\n+<https://github.com/django/django>`_. It contains the full source\n+code for all Django releases, and you can browse it online.\n+\n+The Git repository includes several `branches`_:\n+\n+* ``master`` contains the main in-development code which will become\n+  the next packaged release of Django. This is where most development\n+  activity is focused.\n+\n+* ``stable/A.B.x`` are the maintenance branches. They are used to support\n+  older versions of Django.\n+\n+* ``soc20XX/<project>`` branches were used by students who worked on Django\n+  during the 2009 and 2010 Google Summer of Code programs.\n+\n+* ``attic/<project>`` branches were used to develop major or experimental new\n+  features without affecting the rest of Django's code.\n+\n+The Git repository also contains `tags`_. They identify snapshots of Django's\n+code at various important points in its history. Mostly these are the exact\n+revisions from which packaged Django releases were produced.\n+\n+The source code for `Djangoproject.com <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ Web\n+site can be found at `github.com/django/djangoproject.com\n+<https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com>`_.\n+\n+.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/\n+.. _documentation: http://git-scm.com/documentation\n+.. _branches: https://github.com/django/django/branches\n+.. _tags: https://github.com/django/django/tags\n+\n+Working with Django's master branch\n+===================================\n+\n+If you'd like to try out the in-development code for the next release of\n+Django, or if you'd like to contribute to Django by fixing bugs or developing\n+new features, you'll want to get the code from the master branch.\n+\n+Note that this will get *all* of Django: in addition to the top-level\n+``django`` module containing Python code, you'll also get a copy of Django's\n+documentation, test suite, packaging scripts and other miscellaneous bits.\n+Django's code will be present in your clone as a directory named\n+``django``.\n+\n+To try out the in-development code with your own applications, simply place\n+the directory containing your clone on your Python import path. Then\n+``import`` statements which look for Django will find the ``django`` module\n+within your clone.\n+\n+If you're going to be working on Django's code (say, to fix a bug or\n+develop a new feature), you can probably stop reading here and move\n+over to :doc:`the documentation for contributing to Django\n+</internals/contributing/index>`, which covers things like the preferred\n+coding style and how to generate and submit a patch.\n+\n+Branches\n+========\n+\n+Django uses branches for two main purposes:\n+\n+1. Development of major or experimental features, to keep them from\n+   affecting progress on other work in master.\n+\n+2. Security and bug-fix support for older releases of Django, during\n+   their support lifetimes.\n+\n+Feature-development branches\n+----------------------------\n+\n+.. admonition:: Historical information\n+\n+    Since Django moved to Git in 2012, anyone can clone the repository and\n+    create his own branches, alleviating the need for official branches in the\n+    source code repository.\n+\n+    The following section is mostly useful if you're exploring the repository's\n+    history, for example if you're trying to understand how some features were\n+    designed.\n+\n+Feature-development branches tend by their nature to be temporary. Some\n+produce successful features which are merged back into Django's master to\n+become part of an official release, but others do not; in either case there\n+comes a time when the branch is no longer being actively worked on by any\n+developer. At this point the branch is considered closed.\n+\n+Unfortunately, Django used to be maintained with the Subversion revision\n+control system, that has no standard way of indicating this. As a workaround,\n+branches of Django which are closed and no longer maintained were moved into\n+``attic``.\n+\n+For reference, the following are branches whose code eventually became\n+part of Django itself, and so are no longer separately maintained:\n+\n+* ``boulder-oracle-sprint``: Added support for Oracle databases to\n+  Django's object-relational mapper. This has been part of Django\n+  since the 1.0 release.\n+\n+* ``gis``: Added support for geographic/spatial queries to Django's\n+  object-relational mapper. This has been part of Django since the 1.0\n+  release, as the bundled application ``django.contrib.gis``.\n+\n+* ``i18n``: Added :doc:`internationalization support </topics/i18n/index>` to\n+  Django. This has been part of Django since the 0.90 release.\n+\n+* ``magic-removal``: A major refactoring of both the internals and\n+  public APIs of Django's object-relational mapper. This has been part\n+  of Django since the 0.95 release.\n+\n+* ``multi-auth``: A refactoring of :doc:`Django's bundled\n+  authentication framework </topics/auth>` which added support for\n+  :ref:`authentication backends <authentication-backends>`. This has\n+  been part of Django since the 0.95 release.\n+\n+* ``new-admin``: A refactoring of :doc:`Django's bundled\n+  administrative application </ref/contrib/admin/index>`. This became part of\n+  Django as of the 0.91 release, but was superseded by another\n+  refactoring (see next listing) prior to the Django 1.0 release.\n+\n+* ``newforms-admin``: The second refactoring of Django's bundled\n+  administrative application. This became part of Django as of the 1.0\n+  release, and is the basis of the current incarnation of\n+  ``django.contrib.admin``.\n+\n+* ``queryset-refactor``: A refactoring of the internals of Django's\n+  object-relational mapper. This became part of Django as of the 1.0\n+  release.\n+\n+* ``unicode``: A refactoring of Django's internals to consistently use\n+  Unicode-based strings in most places within Django and Django\n+  applications.

However, if you'd like to try out in-development\n-code from an upcoming release or contribute to the development of\n-Django, you'll need to obtain a checkout from Django's source code\n-repository. This document covers the way the code repository is laid\n-out and how to work with and find things in it.\n-\n-\n-.. _an official packaged release of Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/\n-\n-\n-High-level overview\n-===================\n-\n-The Django source code repository uses `Subversion`_ to track changes\n-to the code over time, so you'll need a copy of the Subversion client\n-(a program called ``svn``) on your computer, and you'll want to\n-familiarize yourself with the basics of how Subversion\n-works. Subversion's Web site offers downloads for various operating\n-systems, and `a free online book`_ is available to help you get up to\n-speed with using Subversion.\n-\n-The Django Subversion repository is located online at\n-`code.djangoproject.com/svn <https://code.djangoproject.com/svn/>`_. `A\n-friendly Web-based interface for browsing the code`_ is also\n-available, though when using Subversion you'll always want to use the\n-repository address instead. At the top level of the repository are two\n-directories: ``django`` contains the full source code for all Django\n-releases, while ``djangoproject.com`` contains the source code and\n-templates for the `djangoproject.com <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_\n-Web site. For trying out in-development Django code, or contributing\n-to Django, you'll always want to check out code from some location in\n-the ``django`` directory.\n-\n-Inside the ``django`` directory, Django's source code is organized\n-into three areas:\n-\n-* ``branches`` contains branched copies of Django's code, which are\n-  (or were) maintained for various purposes. Some branches exist to\n-  provide a place to develop major or experimental new features\n-  without affecting the rest of Django's code, while others serve to\n-  provide bug fixes or support for older Django releases.\n-\n-* ``tags`` contains snapshots of Django's code at various important\n-  points in its history; mostly these are the exact revisions from\n-  which packaged Django releases were produced.\n-\n-* ``trunk`` contains the main in-development code which will become\n-  the next packaged release of Django, and is where most development\n-  activity is focused.\n-\n-\n-.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/\n-.. _a free online book: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/\n-.. _A friendly Web-based interface for browsing the code: https://code.djangoproject.com/browser/\n-\n-\n-Working with Django's trunk\n-===========================\n-\n-If you'd like to try out the in-development code for the next release\n-of Django, or if you'd like to contribute to Django by fixing bugs or\n-developing new features, you'll want to get the code from trunk. You\n-can get a complete copy of this code (a \"Subversion checkout\") by\n-typing::\n-\n-    svn co https://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/\n-\n-Note that this will get *all* of Django: in addition to the top-level\n-``django`` module containing Python code, you'll also get a copy of\n-Django's documentation, unit-test suite, packaging scripts and other\n-miscellaneous bits. Django's code will be present in your checkout as\n-a directory named ``django``.\n-\n-To try out the in-development trunk code with your own applications,\n-simply place the directory containing your checkout on your Python\n-import path. Then ``import`` statements which look for Django will find\n-the ``django`` module within your checkout.\n-\n-If you're going to be working on Django's code (say, to fix a bug or\n-develop a new feature), you can probably stop reading here and move\n-over to :doc:`the documentation for contributing to Django\n-</internals/contributing/index>`, which covers things like the preferred\n-coding style and how to generate and submit a patch.\n-\n-\n-Branches\n-========\n-\n-Django uses branches for two main purposes:\n-\n-1. Development of major or experimental features, to keep them from\n-   affecting progress on other work in trunk.\n-\n-2. Security and bug-fix support for older releases of Django, during\n-   their support lifetimes.\n-\n-\n-Feature-development branches\n-----------------------------\n-\n-Feature-development branches tend by their nature to be\n-temporary. Some produce successful features which are merged back into\n-Django's trunk to become part of an official release, but others do\n-not; in either case there comes a time when the branch is no longer\n-being actively worked on by any developer. At this point the branch is\n-considered closed.\n-\n-Unfortunately, Subversion has no standard way of indicating this. As a\n-workaround, branches of Django which are closed and no longer\n-maintained are moved into the directory ``django/branches/attic``.\n-\n-For reference, the following are branches whose code eventually became\n-part of Django itself, and so are no longer separately maintained:\n-\n-* ``boulder-oracle-sprint``: Added support for Oracle databases to\n-  Django's object-relational mapper. This has been part of Django\n-  since the 1.0 release.\n-\n-* ``gis``: Added support for geographic/spatial queries to Django's\n-  object-relational mapper. This has been part of Django since the 1.0\n-  release, as the bundled application ``django.contrib.gis``.\n-\n-* ``i18n``: Added :doc:`internationalization support </topics/i18n/index>` to\n-  Django. This has been part of Django since the 0.90 release.\n-\n-* ``magic-removal``: A major refactoring of both the internals and\n-  public APIs of Django's object-relational mapper. This has been part\n-  of Django since the 0.95 release.\n-\n-* ``multi-auth``: A refactoring of :doc:`Django's bundled\n-  authentication framework </topics/auth>` which added support for\n-  :ref:`authentication backends <authentication-backends>`. This has\n-  been part of Django since the 0.95 release.\n-\n-* ``new-admin``: A refactoring of :doc:`Django's bundled\n-  administrative application </ref/contrib/admin/index>`. This became part of\n-  Django as of the 0.91 release, but was superseded by another\n-  refactoring (see next listing) prior to the Django 1.0 release.\n-\n-* ``newforms-admin``: The second refactoring of Django's bundled\n-  administrative application. This became part of Django as of the 1.0\n-  release, and is the basis of the current incarnation of\n-  ``django.contrib.admin``.\n-\n-* ``queryset-refactor``: A refactoring of the internals of Django's\n-  object-relational mapper. This became part of Django as of the 1.0\n-  release.\n-\n-* ``unicode``: A refactoring of Django's internals to consistently use\n-  Unicode-based strings in most places within Django and Django\n-  applications. This became part of Django as of the 1.0 release.\n-\n-Additionally, the following branches are closed, but their code was\n-never merged into Django and the features they aimed to implement\n-were never finished:\n-\n-* ``full-history``\n-\n-* ``generic-auth``\n-\n-* ``multiple-db-support``\n-\n-* ``per-object-permissions``\n-\n-* ``schema-evolution``\n-\n-* ``schema-evolution-ng``\n-\n-* ``search-api``\n-\n-* ``sqlalchemy``\n-\n-All of the above-mentioned branches now reside in\n-``django/branches/attic``.\n-\n-\n-Support and bugfix branches\n----------------------------\n-\n-In addition to fixing bugs in current trunk, the Django project\n-provides official bug-fix support for the most recent released version\n-of Django, and security support for the two most recently-released\n-versions of Django. This support is provided via branches in which the\n-necessary bug or security fixes are applied; the branches are then\n-used as the basis for issuing bugfix or security releases.\n-\n-As of the Django 1.0 release, these branches can be found in the\n-repository in the directory ``django/branches/releases``, and new branches\n-will be created there approximately one month after each new Django\n-release. For example, shortly after the release of Django 1.0, the\n-branch ``django/branches/releases/1.0.X`` was created to receive bug\n-fixes, and shortly after the release of Django 1.1 the branch\n-``django/branches/releases/1.1.X`` was created.\n-\n-Prior to the Django 1.0 release, these branches were maintained within\n-the top-level ``django/branches`` directory, and so the following\n-branches exist there and provided support for older Django releases:\n-\n-* ``0.90-bugfixes``\n-\n-* ``0.91-bugfixes``\n-\n-* ``0.95-bugfixes``\n-\n-* ``0.96-bugfixes``\n-\n-Official support for those releases has expired, and so they no longer\n-receive direct maintenance from the Django project. However, the\n-branches continue to exist and interested community members have\n-occasionally used them to provide unofficial support for old Django\n-releases.\n-\n-\n-Tags\n-====\n-\n-The directory ``django/tags`` within the repository contains complete\n-copies of the Django source code as it existed at various points in\n-its history. These \"tagged\" copies of Django are *never* changed or\n-updated; new tags may be added as needed, but once added they are\n-considered read-only and serve as useful guides to Django's\n-development history.\n-\n-Within ``django/tags/releases`` are copies of the code which formed each\n-packaged release of Django, and each tag is named with the version\n-number of the release to which it corresponds. So, for example,\n-``django/tags/releases/1.1`` is a complete copy of the code which was\n-packaged as the Django 1.1 release.\n-\n-Within ``django/tags/notable_moments`` are copies of the Django code from\n-points which do not directly correspond to releases, but which are\n-nonetheless important historical milestones for Django\n-development. The current \"notable moments\" marked there are:\n-\n-* ``ipo``: Django's code as it existed at the moment Django was first\n-  publicly announced in 2005.\n-\n-* ``pre-magic-removal``: The state of Django's code just before the\n-  merging of the ``magic-removal`` branch (described above), which\n-  significantly updated Django's object-relational mapper.\n-\n-* ``pre-newforms-admin``: The state of Django's code just before the\n-  merging of the ``newforms-admin`` branch (see above), which\n-  significantly updated Django's bundled administrative application.\n-\n-* Tags corresponding to each of the alpha, beta and release-candidate\n-  packages in the run up to the Django 1.0 release."
