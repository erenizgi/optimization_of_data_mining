Python 2.6 is now the minimum\n+required Python version. Django is tested and supported on Python 2.6 and\n+2.7.\n+\n+This change should affect only a small number of Django users, as most\n+operating-system vendors today are shipping Python 2.6 or newer as their default\n+version. If you're still using Python 2.5, however, you'll need to stick to\n+Django 1.4 until you can upgrade. Per :doc:`our support policy\n+</internals/release-process>`, Django 1.4 will continue to receive security\n+support until the release of Django 1.6.\n+\n+As Jython does currently not offer any version compatible with Python 2.6,\n+Django 1.5 does not run on Jython.\n+\n+What's new in Django 1.5\n+========================\n+\n+Backwards incompatible changes in 1.5\n+=====================================\n+\n+Features deprecated in 1.5\n+==========================\n+"
