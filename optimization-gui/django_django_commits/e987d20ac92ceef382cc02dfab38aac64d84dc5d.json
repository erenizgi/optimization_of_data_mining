Some attacks against this are beyond Django's ability to control, and\n+require the web server to be properly configured; Django's documentation has\n+for some time contained notes advising users on such configuration.\n+\n+Django's own built-in parsing of the Host header is, however, still vulnerable,\n+as was reported to us recently. The Host header parsing in Django 1.3.3 and\n+Django 1.4.1 -- specifically, django.http.HttpRequest.get_host() -- was\n+incorrectly handling username/password information in the header. Thus, for\n+example, the following Host header would be accepted by Django when running on\n+\"validsite.com\"::\n+\n+    Host: validsite.com:random@evilsite.com\n+\n+Using this, an attacker can cause parts of Django -- particularly the\n+password-reset mechanism -- to generate and display arbitrary URLs to users.\n+\n+To remedy this, the parsing in HttpRequest.get_host() is being modified; Host\n+headers which contain potentially dangerous content (such as username/password\n+pairs) now raise the exception django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation\n+\n+Details of this issue were initially posted online as a `security advisory`_.\n+\n+.. _security advisory: https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/oct/17/security/\n+\n Backwards incompatible changes\n ==============================\n \n * The newly introduced :class:`~django.db.models.GenericIPAddressField`\n   constructor arguments have been adapted to match those of all other model\n   fields. The first two keyword arguments are now verbose_name and name.\n+\n+Other bugfixes and changes\n+==========================\n+\n+* Subclass HTMLParser only for appropriate Python versions (#18239).\n+* Added batch_size argument to qs.bulk_create() (#17788).\n+* Fixed a small regression in the admin filters where wrongly formatted dates passed as url parameters caused an unhandled ValidationError (#18530).\n+* Fixed an endless loop bug when accessing permissions in templates (#18979)\n+* Fixed some Python 2.5 compatibility issues\n+* Fixed an issue with quoted filenames in Content-Disposition header (#19006)\n+* Made the context option in ``trans`` and ``blocktrans`` tags accept literals wrapped in single quotes (#18881).\n+* Numerous documentation improvements and fixes."
