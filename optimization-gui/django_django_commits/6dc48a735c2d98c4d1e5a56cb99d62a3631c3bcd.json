This will probably mean a new release of Django, but\n       in some cases it may simply be patches against current releases.\n \n+Reporting user interface bugs and features\n+------------------------------------------\n+\n+If your bug or feature request touches on anything visual in nature, there\n+are a few additional guidelines to follow:\n+\n+    * Include screenshots in your ticket which are the visual equivalent of a\n+      minimal testcase. Show off the issue, not the crazy customizations\n+      you've made to your browser.\n+    \n+    * If the issue is difficult to show off using a still image, consider\n+      capturing a *brief* screencast. If your software permits it, capture only\n+      the relevant area of the screen.\n+    \n+    * If you're offering a patch which changes the look or behavior of Django's\n+      UI, you **must** attach before *and* after screenshots/screencasts.\n+      Tickets lacking these are difficult for triagers and core developers to\n+      assess quickly.\n+\n+    * Screenshots don't absolve you of other good reporting practices. Make sure\n+      to include URLs, code snippets, and step-by-step instructions on how to\n+      reproduce the behavior visible in the screenshots.\n+\n+    * Make sure to set the UI/UX flag on the ticket so interested parties can\n+      find your ticket.\n+\n Requesting features\n -------------------\n "
