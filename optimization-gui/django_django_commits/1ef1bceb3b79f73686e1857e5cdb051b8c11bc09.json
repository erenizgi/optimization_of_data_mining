As such, we've\n+adopted and follow a set of policies which conform to that ideal and\n+are geared toward allowing us to deliver timely security updates to\n+the official distribution of Django, as well as to third-party\n+distributions.\n+\n+.. _reporting-security-issues:\n+\n+Reporting security issues\n+=========================\n+\n+**Short version: please report security issues by emailing\n+security@djangoproject.com**.\n+\n+Most normal bugs in Django are reported to `our public Trac\n+instance`_, but due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask\n+that they *not* be publicly reported in this fashion.\n+\n+Instead, if you believe you've found something in Django which has\n+security implications, please send a description of the issue via\n+email to ``security@djangoproject.com``. Mail sent to that address\n+reaches a subset of the core development team, who can forward\n+security issues into the private committers' mailing list for broader\n+discussion if needed.\n+\n+You can send encrypted email to this address; the public key ID for\n+``security@djangoproject.com`` is ``0xfcb84b8d1d17f80b``, and this\n+public key is available from most commonly-used keyservers.\n+\n+Once you've submitted an issue via email, you should receive an\n+acknowledgment from a member of the Django development team within 48\n+hours, and depending on the action to be taken, you may receive\n+further followup emails.\n+\n+.. _our public Trac instance: https://code.djangoproject.com/query\n+\n+.. _security-support:\n+\n+Supported versions\n+==================\n+\n+At any given time, the Django team provides official security support\n+for several versions of Django:\n+\n+* The `master development branch`_, hosted on GitHub, which will\n+  become the next release of Django, receives security support.\n+\n+* The two most recent Django release series receive security\n+  support. For example, during the development cycle leading to the\n+  release of Django 1.5, support will be provided for Django 1.4 and\n+  Django 1.3. Upon the release of Django 1.5, Django 1.3's security\n+  support will end.\n+\n+When new releases are issued for security reasons, the accompanying\n+notice will include a list of affected versions. This list is\n+comprised solely of *supported* versions of Django: older versions may\n+also be affected, but we do not investigate to determine that, and\n+will not issue patches or new releases for those versions.\n+\n+.. _master development branch: https://github.com/django/django/\n+\n+.. _security-disclosure:\n+\n+How Django discloses security issues\n+====================================\n+\n+Our process for taking a security issue from private discussion to\n+public disclosure involves multiple steps.\n+\n+Approximately one week before full public disclosure, we will send\n+advance notification of the issue to a list of people and\n+organizations, primarily composed of operating-system vendors and\n+other distributors of Django. This notification will consist of an\n+email message, signed with the Django release key, containing:\n+\n+* A full description of the issue and the affected versions of Django.\n+\n+* The steps we will be taking to remedy the issue.\n+\n+* The patch(es), if any, that will be applied to Django.\n+\n+* The date on which the Django team will apply these patches, issue\n+  new releases and publicy disclose the issue.\n+\n+Simultaneously, the reporter of the issue will receive notification of\n+the date on which we plan to take the issue public.\n+\n+On the day of disclosure, we will take the following steps:\n+\n+1. Apply the relevant patch(es) to Django's codebase. The commit\n+   messages for these patches will indicate that they are for security\n+   issues, but will not describe the issue in any detail; instead,\n+   they will warn of upcoming disclosure.\n+\n+2. Issue the relevant release(s), by placing new packages on `the\n+   Python Package Index`_ and on the Django website, and tagging the\n+   new release(s) in Django's git repository.\n+\n+3. Post a public entry on `the official Django development blog`_,\n+   describing the issue and its resolution in detail, pointing to the\n+   relevant patches and new releases, and crediting the reporter of\n+   the issue (if the reporter wishes to be publicly identified).\n+\n+.. _the Python Package Index: http://pypi.python.org/pypi\n+.. _the official Django development blog: https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/\n+\n+If a reported issue is believed to be particularly time-sensitive --\n+due to a known exploit in the wild, for example -- the time between\n+advance notification and public disclosure may be shortened\n+considerably.\n+\n+Additionally, if we have reason to believe that an issue reported to\n+us affects other frameworks or tools in the Python/web ecosystem, we\n+may privately contact and discuss those issues with the appropriate\n+maintainers, and coordinate our own disclosure and resolution with\n+theirs.\n+\n+.. _security-notifications:\n+\n+Who receives advance notification\n+=================================\n+\n+The full list of people and organizations who receive advance\n+notification of security issues is not and will not be made public.\n+\n+We also aim to keep this list as small as effectively possible, in\n+order to better manage the flow of confidential information prior to\n+disclosure. As such, our notification list is *not* simply a list of\n+users of Django, and merely being a user of Django is not sufficient\n+reason to be placed on the notification list.\n+\n+In broad terms, recipients of security notifications fall into three\n+groups:\n+\n+1. Operating-system vendors and other distributors of Django who\n+   provide a suitably-generic (i.e., *not* an individual's personal\n+   email address) contact address for reporting issues with their\n+   Django package, or for general security reporting. In either case,\n+   such addresses **must not** forward to public mailing lists or bug\n+   trackers. Addresses which forward to the private email of an\n+   individual maintainer or security-response contact are acceptable,\n+   although private security trackers or security-response groups are\n+   strongly preferred.\n+\n+2. On a case-by-case basis, individual package maintainers who have\n+   demonstrated a commitment to responding to and responsibly acting\n+   on these notifications.\n+\n+3. On a case-by-case basis, other entities who, in the judgment of the\n+   Django development team, need to be made aware of a pending\n+   security issue. Typically, membership in this group will consist of\n+   some of the largest and/or most likely to be severely impacted\n+   known users or distributors of Django, and will require a\n+   demonstrated ability to responsibly receive, keep confidential and\n+   act on these notifications.\n+\n+Additionally, a maximum of six days prior to disclosure, notification\n+will be sent to the ``distros@vs.openwall.org`` mailing list, whose\n+membership includes representatives of most major open-source\n+operating system vendors.\n+\n+Requesting notifications\n+========================\n+\n+If you believe that you, or an organization you are authorized to\n+represent, fall into one of the groups listed above, you can ask to be\n+added to Django's notification list by emailing\n+``security@djangoproject.com``. Please use the subject line \"Security\n+notification request\".\n+\n+Your request **must** include the following information:\n+\n+* Your full, real name and the name of the organization you represent,\n+  if applicable, as well as your role within that organization.\n+\n+* A detailed explanation of how you or your organization fit at least\n+  one set of criteria listed above.\n+\n+* A detailed explanation of why you are requesting security\n+  notifications. Again, please keep in mind that this is *not* simply\n+  a list for users of Django, and the overwhelming majority of users\n+  of Django should not request notifications and will not be added to\n+  our notification list if they do.\n+\n+* The email address you would like to have added to our notification\n+  list.\n+\n+* An explanation of who will be receiving/reviewing mail sent to that\n+  address, as well as information regarding any automated actions that\n+  will be taken (i.e., filing of a confidential issue in a bug\n+  tracker).\n+\n+* For individuals, the ID of a public key associated with your address\n+  which can be used to verify email received from you and encrypt\n+  email sent to you, as needed.\n+\n+Once submitted, your request will be considered by the Django\n+development team; you will receive a reply notifying you of the result\n+of your request within 30 days.\n+\n+Please also bear in mind that for any individual or organization,\n+receiving security notifications is a privilege granted at the sole\n+discretion of the Django development team, and that this privilege can\n+be revoked at any time, with or without explanation.\n+\n+If you are added to the notification list, security-related emails\n+will be sent to you by Django's release manager, and all notification\n+emails will be signed with the same key used to sign Django releases;\n+that key has the ID ``0x3684C0C08C8B2AE1``, and is available from most\n+commonly-used keyservers.\n\\ No newline at end of file"
