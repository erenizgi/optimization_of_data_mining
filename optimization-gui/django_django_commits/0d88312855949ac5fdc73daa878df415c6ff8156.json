            "patch": "@@ -57,11 +57,9 @@ In previous versions of Django, it was common to place static assets in\n :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` along with user-uploaded files, and serve them both at\n :setting:`MEDIA_URL`. Part of the purpose of introducing the ``staticfiles``\n app is to make it easier to keep static files separate from user-uploaded\n-files. For this reason, you will probably want to make your\n-:setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` and :setting:`MEDIA_URL` different from your\n-:setting:`STATIC_ROOT` and :setting:`STATIC_URL`. You will need to\n-arrange for serving of files in :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` yourself;\n-``staticfiles`` does not deal with user-uploaded media at all.\n+files. Static assets should now go in ``static/`` subdirectories of your apps\n+or in \"project-wide\" static directories listed in :setting:`STATICFILES_DIRS`,\n+and will be served at :setting:`STATIC_URL`.\n \n See the :doc:`reference documentation of the app </ref/contrib/staticfiles>`\n for more details or learn how to :doc:`manage static files"
