Maybe you've found a bug\n+in Django that you'd like to see fixed, or maybe there's a small feature you\n+want added.\n+\n+Contributing back to Django itself is the best way to see your own concerns\n+addressed. This may seem daunting at first, but it's really pretty simple.\n+We'll walk you through the entire process, so you can learn by example.\n+\n+Who's this tutorial for?\n+------------------------\n+\n+For this tutorial, we expect that you have at least a basic understanding of\n+how Django works. This means you should be comfortable going through the\n+existing tutorials on :doc:`writing your first Django app</intro/tutorial01>`.\n+In addition, you should have a good understanding of Python itself. But if you\n+don't, `Dive Into Python`__ is a fantastic (and free) online book for beginning\n+Python programmers.\n+\n+Those of you who are unfamiliar with version control systems and Trac will find\n+that this tutorial and its links include just enough information to get started.\n+However, you'll probably want to read some more about these different tools if\n+you plan on contributing to Django regularly.\n+\n+For the most part though, this tutorial tries to explain as much as possible,\n+so that it can be of use to the widest audience.\n+\n+.. admonition:: Where to get help:\n+\n+    If you're having trouble going through this tutorial, please post a message\n+    to `django-developers`__ or drop by `#django-dev on irc.freenode.net`__ to\n+    chat with other Django users who might be able to help.\n+\n+__ http://diveintopython.net/toc/index.html\n+__ http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers\n+__ irc://irc.freenode.net/django-dev\n+\n+What does this tutorial cover?\n+------------------------------\n+\n+We'll be walking you through contributing a patch to Django for the first time.\n+By the end of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of both the\n+tools and the processes involved. Specifically, we'll be covering the following:\n+\n+* Installing Git.\n+* How to download a development copy of Django.\n+* Running Django's test suite.\n+* Writing a test for your patch.\n+* Writing the code for your patch.\n+* Testing your patch.\n+* Generating a patch file for your changes.\n+* Where to look for more information.\n+\n+Once you're done with the tutorial, you can look through the rest of\n+:doc:`Django's documentation on contributing</internals/contributing/index>`.\n+It contains lots of great information and is a must read for anyone who'd like\n+to become a regular contributor to Django. If you've got questions, it's\n+probably got the answers.\n+\n+Installing Git\n+==============\n+\n+For this tutorial, you'll need Git installed to download the current\n+development version of Django and to generate patch files for the changes you\n+make.\n+\n+To check whether or not you have Git installed, enter ``git`` into the command\n+line. If you get messages saying that this command could be found, you'll have\n+to download and install it, see `Git's download page`__.\n+\n+If you're not that familiar with Git, you can always find out more about its\n+commands (once it's installed) by typing ``git help`` into the command line.\n+\n+__ http://git-scm.com/download\n+\n+Getting a copy of Django's development version\n+==============================================\n+\n+The first step to contributing to Django is to get a copy of the source code.\n+From the command line, use the ``cd`` command to navigate to the directory\n+where you'll want your local copy of Django to live.\n+\n+Download the Django source code repository using the following command::\n+\n+    git clone https://github.com/django/django.git\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    For users who wish to use `virtualenv`__, you can use::\n+\n+        pip install -e /path/to/your/local/clone/django/\n+\n+    to link your cloned checkout into a virtual environment. This is a great\n+    option to isolate your development copy of Django from the rest of your\n+    system and avoids potential package conflicts.\n+\n+__ http://www.virtualenv.org\n+\n+Rolling back to a previous revision of Django\n+=============================================\n+\n+For this tutorial, we'll be using `ticket #17549`__ as a case study, so we'll\n+rewind Django's version history in git to before that ticket's patch was\n+applied. This will allow us to go through all of the steps involved in writing\n+that patch from scratch, including running Django's test suite.\n+\n+**Keep in mind that while we'll be using an older revision of Django's trunk\n+for the purposes of the tutorial below, you should always use the current\n+development revision of Django when working on your own patch for a ticket!**\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The patch for this ticket was written by Ulrich Petri, and it was applied\n+    to Django as `commit ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc`__.\n+    Consequently, we'll be using the revision of Django just prior to that,\n+    `commit 39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac`__.\n+\n+__ https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17549\n+__ https://github.com/django/django/commit/ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc\n+__ https://github.com/django/django/commit/39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac\n+\n+Navigate into Django's root directory (that's the one that contains ``django``,\n+``docs``, ``tests``, ``AUTHORS``, etc.). You can then check out the older\n+revision of Django that we'll be using in the tutorial below::\n+\n+    git checkout 39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac\n+\n+Running Django's test suite for the first time\n+==============================================\n+\n+When contributing to Django it's very important that your code changes don't\n+introduce bugs into other areas of Django.  One way to check that Django still\n+works after you make your changes is by running Django's test suite. If all\n+the tests still pass, then you can be reasonably sure that your changes\n+haven't completely broken Django. If you've never run Django's test suite\n+before, it's a good idea to run it once beforehand just to get familiar with\n+what its output is supposed to look like.\n+\n+We can run the test suite by simply ``cd``-ing into the Django ``tests/``\n+directory and, if you're using GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of\n+Unix, run::\n+\n+    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite\n+\n+If you're on Windows, the above should work provided that you are using\n+\"Git Bash\" provided by the default Git install. GitHub has a `nice tutorial`__.\n+\n+__ https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    If you're using ``virtualenv``, you can omit ``PYTHONPATH=..`` when running\n+    the tests. This instructs Python to look for Django in the parent directory\n+    of ``tests``. ``virtualenv`` puts your copy of Django on the ``PYTHONPATH``\n+    automatically.\n+\n+Now sit back and relax. Django's entire test suite has over 4800 different\n+tests, so it can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to run, depending on the\n+speed of your computer.\n+\n+While Django's test suite is running, you'll see a stream of characters\n+representing the status of each test as it's run. ``E`` indicates that an error\n+was raised during a test, and ``F`` indicates that a test's assertions failed.\n+Both of these are considered to be test failures. Meanwhile, ``x`` and ``s``\n+indicated expected failures and skipped tests, respectively. Dots indicate\n+passing tests.\n+\n+Skipped tests are typically due to missing external libraries required to run\n+the test; see :ref:`running-unit-tests-dependencies` for a list of dependencies\n+and be sure to install any for tests related to the changes you are making (we\n+won't need any for this tutorial).\n+\n+Once the tests complete, you should be greeted with a message informing you\n+whether the test suite passed or failed. Since you haven't yet made any changes\n+to Django's code, the entire test suite **should** pass. If you get failures or\n+errors make sure you've followed all of the previous steps properly. See\n+:ref:`running-unit-tests` for more information.\n+\n+Note that the latest Django trunk may not always be stable. When developing\n+against trunk, you can check `Django's continuous integration builds`__ to\n+determine if the failures are specific to your machine or if they are also\n+present in Django's official builds. If you click to view a particular build,\n+you can view the \"Configuration Matrix\" which shows failures broken down by\n+Python version and database backend.\n+\n+__ http://ci.djangoproject.com/\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    For this tutorial and the ticket we're working on, testing against SQLite\n+    is sufficient, however, it's possible (and sometimes necessary) to\n+    :ref:`run the tests using a different database\n+    <running-unit-tests-settings>`.\n+\n+Writing some tests for your ticket\n+==================================\n+\n+In most cases, for a patch to be accepted into Django it has to include tests.\n+For bug fix patches, this means writing a regression test to ensure that the\n+bug is never reintroduced into Django later on. A regression test should be\n+written in such a way that it will fail while the bug still exists and pass\n+once the bug has been fixed. For patches containing new features, you'll need\n+to include tests which ensure that the new features are working correctly.\n+They too should fail when the new feature is not present, and then pass once it\n+has been implemented.\n+\n+A good way to do this is to write your new tests first, before making any\n+changes to the code. This style of development is called\n+`test-driven development`__ and can be applied to both entire projects and\n+single patches. After writing your tests, you then run them to make sure that\n+they do indeed fail (since you haven't fixed that bug or added that feature\n+yet). If your new tests don't fail, you'll need to fix them so that they do.\n+After all, a regression test that passes regardless of whether a bug is present\n+is not very helpful at preventing that bug from reoccurring down the road.\n+\n+Now for our hands-on example.\n+\n+__ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\n+\n+Writing some tests for ticket #17549\n+------------------------------------\n+\n+`Ticket #17549`__ describes the following, small feature addition:\n+\n+    It's useful for URLField to give you a way to open the URL; otherwise you\n+    might as well use a CharField.\n+\n+In order to resolve this ticket, we'll add a ``render`` method to the\n+``AdminURLFieldWidget`` in order to display a clickable link above the input\n+widget. Before we make those changes though, we're going to write a couple\n+tests to verify that our modification functions correctly and continues to\n+function correctly in the future.\n+\n+Navigate to Django's ``tests/regressiontests/admin_widgets/`` folder and\n+open the ``tests.py`` file. Add the following code on line 269 right before the\n+``AdminFileWidgetTest`` class::\n+\n+    class AdminURLWidgetTest(DjangoTestCase):\n+        def test_render(self):\n+            w = widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget()\n+            self.assertHTMLEqual(\n+                conditional_escape(w.render('test', '')),\n+                '<input class=\"vURLField\" name=\"test\" type=\"text\" />'\n+            )\n+            self.assertHTMLEqual(\n+                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example.com')),\n+                '<p class=\"url\">Currently:<a href=\"http://example.com\">http://example.com</a><br />Change:<input class=\"vURLField\" name=\"test\" type=\"text\" value=\"http://example.com\" /></p>'\n+            )\n+\n+        def test_render_idn(self):\n+            w = widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget()\n+            self.assertHTMLEqual(\n+                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example-äüö.com')),\n+                '<p class=\"url\">Currently:<a href=\"http://xn--example--7za4pnc.com\">http://example-äüö.com</a><br />Change:<input class=\"vURLField\" name=\"test\" type=\"text\" value=\"http://example-äüö.com\" /></p>'\n+            )\n+\n+        def test_render_quoting(self):\n+            w = widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget()\n+            self.assertHTMLEqual(\n+                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>')),\n+                '<p class=\"url\">Currently:<a href=\"http://example.com/%3Csometag%3Esome%20text%3C/sometag%3E\">http://example.com/&lt;sometag&gt;some text&lt;/sometag&gt;</a><br />Change:<input class=\"vURLField\" name=\"test\" type=\"text\" value=\"http://example.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>\" /></p>'\n+            )\n+            self.assertHTMLEqual(\n+                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example-äüö.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>')),\n+                '<p class=\"url\">Currently:<a href=\"http://xn--example--7za4pnc.com/%3Csometag%3Esome%20text%3C/sometag%3E\">http://example-äüö.com/&lt;sometag&gt;some text&lt;/sometag&gt;</a><br />Change:<input class=\"vURLField\" name=\"test\" type=\"text\" value=\"http://example-äüö.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>\" /></p>'\n+            )\n+\n+The new tests check to see that the ``render`` method we'll be adding works\n+correctly in a couple different situations.\n+\n+.. admonition:: But this testing thing looks kinda hard...\n+\n+    If you've never had to deal with tests before, they can look a little hard\n+    to write at first glance. Fortunately, testing is a *very* big subject in\n+    computer programming, so there's lots of information out there:\n+\n+    * A good first look at writing tests for Django can be found in the\n+      documentation on :doc:`Testing Django applications</topics/testing/>`.\n+    * Dive Into Python (a free online book for beginning Python developers)\n+      includes a great `introduction to Unit Testing`__.\n+    * After reading those, if you want something a little meatier to sink\n+      your teeth into, there's always the `Python unittest documentation`__.\n+\n+__ https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17549\n+__ http://diveintopython.net/unit_testing/index.html\n+__ http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html\n+\n+Running your new test\n+---------------------\n+\n+Remember that we haven't actually made any modifications to\n+``AdminURLFieldWidget`` yet, so our tests are going to fail. Let's run all the\n+tests in the ``model_forms_regress`` folder to make sure that's really what\n+happens. From the command line, ``cd`` into the Django ``tests/`` directory\n+and run::\n+\n+    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite admin_widgets\n+\n+If the tests ran correctly, you should see three failures corresponding to each\n+of the test methods we added. If all of the tests passed, then you'll want to\n+make sure that you added the new test shown above to the appropriate folder and\n+class.\n+\n+Writing the code for your ticket\n+================================\n+\n+Next we'll be adding the functionality described in `ticket #17549`__ to Django.\n+\n+Writing the code for ticket #17549\n+----------------------------------\n+\n+Navigate to the ``django/django/contrib/admin/`` folder and open the\n+``widgets.py`` file. Find the ``AdminURLFieldWidget`` class on line 302 and add\n+the following ``render`` method after the existing ``__init__`` method::\n+\n+    def render(self, name, value, attrs=None):\n+        html = super(AdminURLFieldWidget, self).render(name, value, attrs)\n+        if value:\n+            value = force_text(self._format_value(value))\n+            final_attrs = {'href': mark_safe(smart_urlquote(value))}\n+            html = format_html(\n+                '<p class=\"url\">{0} <a {1}>{2}</a><br />{3} {4}</p>',\n+                _('Currently:'), flatatt(final_attrs), value,\n+                _('Change:'), html\n+            )\n+        return html\n+\n+Verifying your test now passes\n+------------------------------\n+\n+Once you're done modifying Django, we need to make sure that the tests we wrote\n+earlier pass, so we can see whether the code we wrote above is working\n+correctly. To run the tests in the ``admin_widgets`` folder, ``cd`` into the\n+Django ``tests/`` directory and run::\n+\n+    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite admin_widgets\n+\n+Oops, good thing we wrote those tests! You should still see 3 failures with\n+the following exception::\n+\n+    NameError: global name 'smart_urlquote' is not defined\n+\n+We forgot to add the import for that method.  Go ahead and add the\n+``smart_urlquote`` import at the end of line 13 of\n+``django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`` so it looks as follows::\n+\n+    from django.utils.html import escape, format_html, format_html_join, smart_urlquote\n+\n+Re-run the tests and everything should pass. If it doesn't, make sure you\n+correctly modified the ``AdminURLFieldWidget`` class as shown above and\n+copied the new tests correctly.\n+\n+__ https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17549\n+\n+Running Django's test suite for the second time\n+===============================================\n+\n+Once you've verified that your patch and your test are working correctly, it's\n+a good idea to run the entire Django test suite just to verify that your change\n+hasn't introduced any bugs into other areas of Django. While successfully\n+passing the entire test suite doesn't guarantee your code is bug free, it does\n+help identify many bugs and regressions that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n+\n+To run the entire Django test suite, ``cd`` into the Django ``tests/``\n+directory and run::\n+\n+    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite\n+\n+As long as you don't see any failures, you're good to go. Note that this fix\n+also made a `small CSS change`__ to format the new widget. You can make the\n+change if you'd like, but we'll skip it for now in the interest of brevity.\n+\n+__ https://github.com/django/django/commit/ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc#diff-0\n+\n+Writing Documentation\n+=====================\n+\n+This is a new feature, so it should be documented.  Add the following on line\n+925 of ``django/docs/ref/models/fields.txt`` beneath the existing docs for\n+``URLField``::\n+\n+    .. versionadded:: 1.5\n+\n+    The current value of the field will be displayed as a clickable link above the\n+    input widget.\n+\n+For more information on writing documentation, including an explanation of what\n+the ``versionadded`` bit is all about, see\n+:doc:`/internals/contributing/writing-documentation`. That page also includes\n+an explanation of how to build a copy of the documentation locally, so you can\n+preview the HTML that will be generated.\n+\n+Generating a patch for your changes\n+===================================\n+\n+Now it's time to generate a patch file that can be uploaded to Trac or applied\n+to another copy of Django. To get a look at the content of your patch, run the\n+following command::\n+\n+    git diff\n+\n+This will display the differences between your current copy of Django (with\n+your changes) and the revision that you initially checked out earlier in the\n+tutorial.\n+\n+Once you're done looking at the patch, hit the ``q`` key to exit back to the\n+command line.  If the patch's content looked okay, you can run the following\n+command to save the patch file to your current working directory::\n+\n+    git diff > 17549.diff\n+\n+You should now have a file in the root Django directory called ``17549.diff``.\n+This patch file contains all your changes and should look this:\n+\n+.. code-block:: diff\n+\n+    diff --git a/django/contrib/admin/widgets.py b/django/contrib/admin/widgets.py\n+    index 1e0bc2d..9e43a10 100644\n+    --- a/django/contrib/admin/widgets.py\n+    +++ b/django/contrib/admin/widgets.py\n+    @@ -10,7 +10,7 @@ from django.contrib.admin.templatetags.admin_static import static\n+     from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse\n+     from django.forms.widgets import RadioFieldRenderer\n+     from django.forms.util import flatatt\n+    -from django.utils.html import escape, format_html, format_html_join\n+    +from django.utils.html import escape, format_html, format_html_join, smart_urlquote\n+     from django.utils.text import Truncator\n+     from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _\n+     from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n+    @@ -306,6 +306,18 @@ class AdminURLFieldWidget(forms.TextInput):\n+                 final_attrs.update(attrs)\n+             super(AdminURLFieldWidget, self).__init__(attrs=final_attrs)\n+\n+    +    def render(self, name, value, attrs=None):\n+    +        html = super(AdminURLFieldWidget, self).render(name, value, attrs)\n+    +        if value:\n+    +            value = force_text(self._format_value(value))\n+    +            final_attrs = {'href': mark_safe(smart_urlquote(value))}\n+    +            html = format_html(\n+    +                '<p class=\"url\">{0} <a {1}>{2}</a><br />{3} {4}</p>',\n+    +                _('Currently:'), flatatt(final_attrs), value,\n+    +                _('Change:'), html\n+    +            )\n+    +        return html\n+    +\n+     class AdminIntegerFieldWidget(forms.TextInput):\n+         class_name = 'vIntegerField'\n+\n+    diff --git a/docs/ref/models/fields.txt b/docs/ref/models/fields.txt\n+    index 809d56e..d44f85f 100644\n+    --- a/docs/ref/models/fields.txt\n+    +++ b/docs/ref/models/fields.txt\n+    @@ -922,6 +922,10 @@ Like all :class:`CharField` subclasses, :class:`URLField` takes the optional\n+     :attr:`~CharField.max_length`argument.

Now that you've\n+got that under your belt, you can put those skills to good use by helping to\n+improve Django's codebase. Generating patches and attaching them to Trac\n+tickets is useful, however, since we are using git - adopting a more :doc:`git\n+oriented workflow </internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git>` is\n+recommended.\n+\n+Since we never committed our changes locally, perform the following to get your\n+git branch back to a good starting point::\n+\n+    git reset --hard HEAD\n+    git checkout master\n+\n+More information for new contributors\n+-------------------------------------\n+\n+Before you get too into writing patches for Django, there's a little more\n+information on contributing that you should probably take a look at:\n+\n+* You should make sure to read Django's documentation on\n+  :doc:`claiming tickets and submitting patches\n+  </internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches>`.\n+  It covers Trac etiquette, how to claim tickets for yourself, expected\n+  coding style for patches, and many other important details.\n+* First time contributors should also read Django's :doc:`documentation\n+  for first time contributors</internals/contributing/new-contributors/>`.\n+  It has lots of good advice for those of us who are new to helping out\n+  with Django.\n+* After those, if you're still hungry for more information about\n+  contributing, you can always browse through the rest of\n+  :doc:`Django's documentation on contributing</internals/contributing/index>`.\n+  It contains a ton of useful information and should be your first source\n+  for answering any questions you might have.\n+\n+Finding your first real ticket\n+------------------------------\n+\n+Once you've looked through some of that information, you'll be ready to go out\n+and find a ticket of your own to write a patch for. Pay special attention to\n+tickets with the \"easy pickings\" criterion. These tickets are often much\n+simpler in nature and are great for first time contributors.  Once you're\n+familiar with contributing to Django, you can move on to writing patches for\n+more difficult and complicated tickets.\n+\n+If you just want to get started already (and nobody would blame you!), try\n+taking a look at the list of `easy tickets that need patches`__ and the\n+`easy tickets that have patches which need improvement`__. If you're familiar\n+with writing tests, you can also look at the list of\n+`easy tickets that need tests`__. Just remember to follow the guidelines about\n+claiming tickets that were mentioned in the link to Django's documentation on\n+:doc:`claiming tickets and submitting patches\n+</internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches>`.\n+\n+__ https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&status=reopened&has_patch=0&easy=1&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=milestone&order=priority\n+__ https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&status=reopened&needs_better_patch=1&easy=1&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=milestone&order=priority\n+__ https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&status=reopened&needs_tests=1&easy=1&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=milestone&order=priority\n+\n+What's next?\n+------------\n+\n+After a ticket has a patch, it needs to be reviewed by a second set of eyes.\n+After uploading a patch or submitting a pull request, be sure to update the\n+ticket metadata by setting the flags on the ticket to say \"has patch\",\n+\"doesn't need tests\", etc, so others can find it for review. Contributing\n+doesn't necessarily always mean writing a patch from scratch. Reviewing\n+existing patches is also a very helpful contribution. See\n+:doc:`/internals/contributing/triaging-tickets` for details."
