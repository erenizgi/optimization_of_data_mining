'opts' is the Options class for the current model\n         (which gives the table we are joining to), 'alias' is the alias for the\n-        table we are joining to. If dupe_multis is True, any many-to-many or\n-        many-to-one joins will always create a new alias (necessary for\n-        disjunctive filters). If can_reuse is not None, it's a list of aliases\n-        that can be reused in these joins (nothing else can be reused in this\n-        case). Finally, 'negate' is used in the same sense as for add_filter()\n+        table we are joining to.\n+\n+        The 'can_reuse' defines the reverse foreign key joins we can reuse. It\n+        can be either sql.constants.REUSE_ALL in which case all joins are\n+        reusable or a set of aliases that can be reused. Non-reverse foreign\n+        keys are always reusable.\n+\n+        The 'allow_explicit_fk' controls if field.attname is allowed in the\n+        lookups.\n+\n+        Finally, 'negate' is used in the same sense as for add_filter()\n         -- it indicates an exclude() filter, or something similar. It is only\n         passed in here so that it can be passed to a field's extra_filter() for\n         customized behavior."
