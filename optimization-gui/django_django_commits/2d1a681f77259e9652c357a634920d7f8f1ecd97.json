Django 1.3 uses the SHA1_ algorithm, but increasing processor speeds\n+and theoretical attacks have revealed that SHA1 isn't as secure as we'd like.\n+Thus, Django 1.4 introduces a new password storage system: by default Django now\n+uses the PBKDF2_ algorithm (as recommended by NIST_). You can also easily choose\n+a different algorithm (including the popular bcrypt_ algorithm). For more\n+details, see :ref:`auth_password_storage`.\n+\n+.. _sha1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1\n+.. _pbkdf2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2\n+.. _nist: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-132/nist-sp800-132.pdf\n+.. _bcrypt: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt\n+\n+\n HTML5 Doctype\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n "
