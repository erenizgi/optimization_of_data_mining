Django 1.2.4 is a recommended upgrade for any\n+development or deployment currently using or targeting Django 1.2.\n+\n+For full details on the new features, backwards incompatibilities, and\n+deprecated features in the 1.2 branch, see the :doc:`/releases/1.2`.\n+\n+One new feature\n+===============\n+\n+Ordinarily, a point release would not include new features, but in the\n+case of Django 1.2.4, we have made an exception to this rule.\n+\n+One of the bugs fixed in Django 1.2.4 involves a set of\n+circumstances whereby a running a test suite on a multiple database\n+configuration could cause the original source database (i.e., the\n+actual production database) to be dropped, causing catastrophic loss\n+of data. In order to provide a fix for this problem, it was necessary\n+to introduce a new setting -- :setting:`TEST_DEPENDENCIES` -- that\n+allows you to define any creation order dependencies in your database\n+configuration.\n+\n+Most users -- even users with multiple-database configurations -- need\n+not be concerned about the data loss bug, or the manual configuration of\n+:setting:`TEST_DEPENDENCIES`. See the `original problem report`_\n+documentation on :ref:`controlling the creation order of test\n+databases <topics-testing-creation-dependencies>` for details.\n+\n+.. _original problem report: http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/14415\n+\n+GeoDjango\n+=========\n+\n+The function-based :setting:`TEST_RUNNER` previously used to execute\n+the GeoDjango test suite, :func:`django.contrib.gis.tests.run_gis_tests`,\n+was finally deprecated in favor of a class-based test runner,\n+:class:`django.contrib.gis.tests.GeoDjangoTestSuiteRunner`, added in this\n+release.\n+\n+In addition, the GeoDjango test suite is now included when\n+:ref:`running the Django test suite <running-unit-tests>` with ``runtests.py``\n+and using :ref:`spatial database backends <spatial-backends>`."
