This means that if you\n+    upgrade to 1.4 and then need to downgrade to 1.3, version 1.3 won't be able\n+    to read the updated passwords.\n+\n+  * Remedy: Set :setting:`PASSWORD_HASHERS` to use your original password\n+    hashing when you initially upgrade to 1.4. After you confirm your app works\n+    well with Django 1.4 and you won't have to roll back to 1.3, enable the new\n+    password hashes.\n \n django.contrib.flatpages\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
