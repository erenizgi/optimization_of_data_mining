This release will remove the old method for\n-          hooking up admin URLs.  This has been deprecated since the 1.1\n-          release.\n-\n-        * Authentication backends need to define the boolean attributes\n-          ``supports_object_permissions`` and ``supports_anonymous_user``.\n-          The old backend style is deprecated since the 1.2 release.\n-\n-        * The :mod:`django.contrib.gis.db.backend` module, including the\n-          ``SpatialBackend`` interface, is deprecated since the 1.2 release.\n-\n-    * 1.4\n-        * ``CsrfResponseMiddleware``.  This has been deprecated since the 1.2\n-          release, in favor of the template tag method for inserting the CSRF\n-          token.  ``CsrfMiddleware``, which combines ``CsrfResponseMiddleware``\n-          and ``CsrfViewMiddleware``, is also deprecated.\n-\n-        * The old imports for CSRF functionality (``django.contrib.csrf.*``),\n-          which moved to core in 1.2, will be removed.\n-\n-        * ``SMTPConnection``. The 1.2 release deprecated the ``SMTPConnection``\n-          class in favor of a generic E-mail backend API.\n-\n-        * The many to many SQL generation functions on the database backends\n-          will be removed.\n-\n-        * The ability to use the ``DATABASE_*`` family of top-level settings to\n-          define database connections will be removed.\n-\n-        * The ability to use shorthand notation to specify a database backend\n-          (i.e., ``sqlite3`` instead of ``django.db.backends.sqlite3``) will be\n-          removed.\n-\n-        * The ``get_db_prep_save``, ``get_db_prep_value`` and\n-          ``get_db_prep_lookup`` methods on Field were modified in 1.2\n-          to support multiple databases. In 1.4, the support functions\n-          that allow methods with the old prototype to continue\n-          working will be removed.\n-\n-        * The ``Message`` model (in ``django.contrib.auth``), its related\n-          manager in the ``User`` model (``user.message_set``), and the\n-          associated methods (``user.message_set.create()`` and\n-          ``user.get_and_delete_messages()``), which have\n-          been deprecated since the 1.2 release, will be removed.  The\n-          :doc:`messages framework </ref/contrib/messages>` should be used\n-          instead. The related ``messages`` variable returned by the\n-          auth context processor will also be removed. Note that this\n-          means that the admin application depends on the messages\n-          context processor.\n-\n-        * Authentication backends need to support the ``obj`` parameter for\n-          permission checking. The ``supports_object_permissions`` variable\n-          is not checked any longer and can be removed.\n-\n-        * Authentication backends need to support the ``AnonymousUser``\n-          being passed to all methods dealing with permissions.\n-          The ``supports_anonymous_user`` variable is not checked any\n-          longer and can be removed.\n-\n-        * The ability to specify a callable template loader rather than a\n-          ``Loader`` class will be removed, as will the ``load_template_source``\n-          functions that are included with the built in template loaders for\n-          backwards compatibility. These have been deprecated since the 1.2\n-          release.\n-\n-        * ``django.utils.translation.get_date_formats()`` and\n-          ``django.utils.translation.get_partial_date_formats()``. These\n-          functions are replaced by the new locale aware formatting; use\n-          ``django.utils.formats.get_format()`` to get the appropriate\n-          formats.\n-\n-        * In ``django.forms.fields``: ``DEFAULT_DATE_INPUT_FORMATS``,\n-          ``DEFAULT_TIME_INPUT_FORMATS`` and\n-          ``DEFAULT_DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS``.

The class-based view ``views.Feed`` should be used instead.\n-\n-        * ``django.core.context_processors.auth``.  This release will\n-          remove the old method in favor of the new method in\n-          ``django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth``.  This has been\n-          deprecated since the 1.2 release.\n-\n-        * The ``postgresql`` database backend has been deprecated in favor of\n-          the ``postgresql_psycopg2`` backend.\n-\n-        * The ``no`` language code has been deprecated in favor of the ``nb``\n-          language code.\n-\n-        * Authentication backends need to define the boolean attribute\n-          ``supports_inactive_user``.\n-\n-        * ``django.db.models.fields.XMLField`` will be removed. This was\n-          deprecated as part of the 1.3 release. An accelerated deprecation\n-          schedule has been used because the field hasn't performed any role\n-          beyond that of a simple ``TextField`` since the removal of oldforms.\n-          All uses of ``XMLField`` can be replaced with ``TextField``.\n-\n-    * 1.5\n-        * The ``mod_python`` request handler has been deprecated since the 1.3\n-          release. The ``mod_wsgi`` handler should be used instead.\n-\n-        * The ``template`` attribute on :class:`~django.test.client.Response`\n-          objects returned by the :ref:`test client <test-client>` has been\n-          deprecated since the 1.3 release. The\n-          :attr:`~django.test.client.Response.templates` attribute should be\n-          used instead.\n-\n-        * The features of the :class:`django.test.simple.DjangoTestRunner`\n-          (including fail-fast and Ctrl-C test termination) can now be provided\n-          by the unittest-native :class:`TextTestRunner`. The\n-          :class:`~django.test.simple.DjangoTestRunner` will be removed in\n-          favor of using the unittest-native class.\n-\n-        * The undocumented function\n-          :func:`django.contrib.formtools.utils.security_hash`\n-          is deprecated, in favor of :func:`django.contrib.formtools.utils.form_hmac`\n-\n-        * The function-based generic views have been deprecated in\n-          favor of their class-based cousins. The following modules\n-          will be removed:\n-\n-              * :mod:`django.views.generic.create_update`\n-              * :mod:`django.views.generic.date_based`\n-              * :mod:`django.views.generic.list_detail`\n-              * :mod:`django.views.generic.simple`\n-\n-        * The :class:`~django.core.servers.basehttp.AdminMediaHandler` has\n-          been deprecated in favor of the\n-          :class:`~django.contrib.staticfiles.handlers.StaticFilesHandler`.\n-\n-        * The :ttag:`url` and :ttag:`ssi` template tags will be\n-          modified so that the first argument to each tag is a\n-          template variable, not an implied string. The new-style\n-          behavior is provided in the ``future`` template tag library.\n-\n-        * The :djadmin:`reset` and :djadmin:`sqlreset` management commands\n-          are deprecated.\n-\n-        * Authentication backends need to support a inactive user\n-          being passed to all methods dealing with permissions.\n-          The ``supports_inactive_user`` variable is not checked any\n-          longer and can be removed.\n-\n-        * :meth:`~django.contrib.gis.geos.GEOSGeometry.transform` will raise\n-          a :class:`~django.contrib.gis.geos.GEOSException` when called\n-          on a geometry with no SRID value.\n-\n-        * :class:`~django.http.CompatCookie` will be removed in favor of\n-          :class:`~django.http.SimpleCookie`.\n-\n-        * :class:`django.core.context_processors.PermWrapper` and\n-          :class:`django.core.context_processors.PermLookupDict`\n-          will be moved to :class:`django.contrib.auth.context_processors.PermWrapper`\n-          and :class:`django.contrib.auth.context_processors.PermLookupDict`,\n-          respectively.\n-\n-        * The :setting:`MEDIA_URL` or :setting:`STATIC_URL` settings are\n-          required to end with a trailing slash to ensure there is a consistent\n-          way to combine paths in templates.\n-\n-    * 1.6\n-        * The compatibility modules ``django.utils.copycompat`` and\n-          ``django.utils.hashcompat`` as well as the functions\n-          ``django.utils.itercompat.all`` and ``django.utils.itercompat.any``\n-          have been deprecated since the 1.4 release. The native versions\n-          should be used instead.\n-\n-        * The :func:`~django.views.decorators.csrf.csrf_response_exempt` and\n-          :func:`~django.views.decorators.csrf.csrf_view_exempt` decorators will\n-          be removed. Since 1.4 ``csrf_response_exempt`` has been a no-op (it\n-          returns the same function), and ``csrf_view_exempt`` has been a\n-          synonym for ``django.views.decorators.csrf.csrf_exempt``, which should\n-          be used to replace it.\n-\n-        * The :class:`~django.core.cache.backends.memcached.CacheClass` backend\n-          was split into two in Django 1.3 in order to introduce support for\n-          PyLibMC. The historical :class:`~django.core.cache.backends.memcached.CacheClass`\n-          is now an alias for :class:`~django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache`.\n-          In Django 1.6, the historical alias will be removed.\n-\n-        * The UK-prefixed objects of ``django.contrib.localflavor.uk`` will only\n-          be accessible through their new GB-prefixed names (GB is the correct\n-          ISO 3166 code for United Kingdom). They have been deprecated since the\n-          1.4 release.\n-\n-        * The :setting:`IGNORABLE_404_STARTS` and :setting:`IGNORABLE_404_ENDS`\n-          settings have been superseded by :setting:`IGNORABLE_404_URLS` in\n-          the 1.4 release. They will be removed.\n-\n-        * The :doc:`form wizard </ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard>` has been\n-          refactored to use class based views with pluggable backends in 1.4.\n-          The previous implementation will be deprecated.\n-\n-        * Legacy ways of calling\n-          :func:`~django.views.decorators.cache.cache_page` will be removed.\n-\n-        * The backward-compatibility shim to automatically add a debug-false\n-          filter to the ``'mail_admins'`` logging handler will be removed. The\n-          :setting:`LOGGING` setting should include this filter explicitly if\n-          it is desired.\n-\n-        * The template tag\n-          :func:`django.contrib.admin.templatetags.adminmedia.admin_media_prefix`\n-          was deprecated since Django 1.4 and will be removed in favor of the\n-          generic static files handling.\n-\n-        * The builin truncation functions\n-          :func:`django.utils.text.truncate_words` and\n-          :func:`django.utils.text.truncate_html_words`\n-          were deprecated since Django 1.4 and will be removed in favor\n-          of the ``django.utils.text.Truncator`` class.\n-\n-    * 2.0\n-        * ``django.views.defaults.shortcut()``. This function has been moved\n-          to ``django.contrib.contenttypes.views.shortcut()`` as part of the\n-          goal of removing all ``django.contrib`` references from the core\n-          Django codebase.
