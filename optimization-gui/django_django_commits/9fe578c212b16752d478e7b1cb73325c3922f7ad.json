It solves the problem of your\n+  proxy \"eating\" the fact that a request came in via HTTPS. But only use this\n+  setting if you know what you're doing.\n+\n * A new, plain-text, version of the HTTP 500 status code internal error page\n   served when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True`` is now sent to the client when\n   Django detects that the request has originated in JavaScript code."
