Users who reverse-engineered this framework will need to upgrade to use the\n-new comment system; this guide explains how.\n-\n-The main changes from the old system are:\n-\n-* This new system is documented.\n-\n-* It uses modern Django features like :doc:`forms </topics/forms/index>` and\n-  :doc:`modelforms </topics/forms/modelforms>`.\n-\n-* It has a single ``Comment`` model instead of separate ``FreeComment`` and\n-  ``Comment`` models.\n-\n-* Comments have \"email\" and \"URL\" fields.\n-\n-* No ratings, photos and karma. This should only effect World Online.\n-\n-* The ``{% comment_form %}`` tag no longer exists. Instead, there's now two\n-  functions: ``{% get_comment_form %}``, which returns a form for posting a\n-  new comment, and ``{% render_comment_form %}``, which renders said form\n-  using the ``comments/form.html`` template.\n-\n-* The way comments are include in your URLconf have changed; you'll need to\n-  replace::\n-\n-        (r'^comments/', include('django.contrib.comments.urls.comments')),\n-\n-  with::\n-\n-        (r'^comments/', include('django.contrib.comments.urls')),\n-\n-Upgrading data\n---------------\n-\n-The data models for Django's comment system have changed, as have the\n-table names. Before you transfer your existing data into the new comments\n-system, make sure that you have installed the new comments system as\n-explained in the\n-:doc:`quick start guide </ref/contrib/comments/index>`.\n-This will ensure that the new tables have been properly created.\n-\n-To transfer your data into the new comments system, you'll need to directly\n-run the following SQL:\n-\n-.. code-block:: sql\n-\n-    BEGIN;\n-\n-    INSERT INTO django_comments \n-        (content_type_id, object_pk, site_id, user_name, user_email, user_url,\n-        comment, submit_date, ip_address, is_public, is_removed)\n-    SELECT\n-        content_type_id, object_id, site_id, person_name, '', '', comment,\n-        submit_date, ip_address, is_public, not approved\n-    FROM comments_freecomment;\n-\n-    INSERT INTO django_comments \n-        (content_type_id, object_pk, site_id, user_id, user_name, user_email,\n-        user_url, comment, submit_date, ip_address, is_public, is_removed)\n-    SELECT \n-        content_type_id, object_id, site_id, user_id, '', '', '', comment,\n-        submit_date, ip_address, is_public, is_removed\n-    FROM comments_comment;\n-\n-    UPDATE django_comments SET user_name = (\n-        SELECT username FROM auth_user \n-        WHERE django_comments.user_id = auth_user.id\n-    ) WHERE django_comments.user_id is not NULL;\n-    UPDATE django_comments SET user_email = (\n-        SELECT email FROM auth_user \n-        WHERE django_comments.user_id = auth_user.id\n-    ) WHERE django_comments.user_id is not NULL;\n-    \n-    COMMIT;"
