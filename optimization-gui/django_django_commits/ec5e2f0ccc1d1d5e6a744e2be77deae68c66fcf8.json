This release is\n+primarily targeted at developers who are interested in trying out new features\n+and testing the Django codebase to help identify and resolve bugs prior to the\n+final 1.4 release.\n+\n+As such, this release is *not* intended for production use, and any such use\n+is discouraged.\n+\n+Django 1.4 beta includes various `new features`_ and some minor `backwards\n+incompatible changes`_. There are also some features that have been dropped,\n+which are detailed in :doc:`our deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>`,\n+and we've `begun the deprecation process for some features`_.\n+\n+.. _new features: `What's new in Django 1.4`_\n+.. _backwards incompatible changes: `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.4`_\n+.. _begun the deprecation process for some features: `Features deprecated in 1.4`_\n+\n+Python compatibility\n+====================\n+\n+While not a new feature, it's important to note that Django 1.4 introduces the\n+second shift in our Python compatibility policy since Django's initial public\n+debut. Django 1.2 dropped support for Python 2.3; now Django 1.4 drops support\n+for Python 2.4. As such, the minimum Python version required for Django is now\n+2.5, and Django is tested and supported on Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.\n+\n+This change should affect only a small number of Django users, as most\n+operating-system vendors today are shipping Python 2.5 or newer as their default\n+version. If you're still using Python 2.4, however, you'll need to stick to\n+Django 1.3 until you can upgrade; per :doc:`our support policy\n+</internals/release-process>`, Django 1.3 will continue to receive security\n+support until the release of Django 1.5.\n+\n+Django does not support Python 3.x at this time. A document outlining our full\n+timeline for deprecating Python 2.x and moving to Python 3.x will be published\n+before the release of Django 1.4.\n+\n+What's new in Django 1.4\n+========================\n+\n+Support for in-browser testing frameworks\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 now supports integration with in-browser testing frameworks such\n+as Selenium_ or Windmill_ thanks to the :class:`django.test.LiveServerTestCase`\n+base class, allowing you to test the interactions between your site's front and\n+back ends more comprehensively. See the\n+:class:`documentation<django.test.LiveServerTestCase>` for more details and\n+concrete examples.\n+\n+.. _Windmill: http://www.getwindmill.com/\n+.. _Selenium: http://seleniumhq.org/\n+\n+``SELECT FOR UPDATE`` support\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 now includes a :meth:`QuerySet.select_for_update()\n+<django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_for_update>` method which generates a\n+``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` SQL query. This will lock rows until the end of the\n+transaction, meaning that other transactions cannot modify or delete rows\n+matched by a ``FOR UPDATE`` query.\n+\n+For more details, see the documentation for\n+:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_for_update`.\n+\n+``Model.objects.bulk_create`` in the ORM\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+This method allows for more efficient creation of multiple objects in the ORM.\n+It can provide significant performance increases if you have many objects.\n+Django makes use of this internally, meaning some operations (such as database\n+setup for test suites) have seen a performance benefit as a result.\n+\n+See the :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.bulk_create` docs for more\n+information.\n+\n+``QuerySet.prefetch_related``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Similar to :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related` but with a\n+different strategy and broader scope,\n+:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.prefetch_related` has been added to\n+:class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet`. This method returns a new\n+``QuerySet`` that will prefetch each of the specified related lookups in a\n+single batch as soon as the query begins to be evaluated. Unlike\n+``select_related``, it does the joins in Python, not in the database, and\n+supports many-to-many relationships,\n+:class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.generic.GenericForeignKey` and more. This\n+allows you to fix a very common performance problem in which your code ends up\n+doing O(n) database queries (or worse) if objects on your primary ``QuerySet``\n+each have many related objects that you also need.\n+\n+Improved password hashing\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django's auth system (``django.contrib.auth``) stores passwords using a one-way\n+algorithm. Django 1.3 uses the SHA1_ algorithm, but increasing processor speeds\n+and theoretical attacks have revealed that SHA1 isn't as secure as we'd like.\n+Thus, Django 1.4 introduces a new password storage system: by default Django now\n+uses the PBKDF2_ algorithm (as recommended by NIST_). You can also easily choose\n+a different algorithm (including the popular bcrypt_ algorithm). For more\n+details, see :ref:`auth_password_storage`.\n+\n+.. _sha1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1\n+.. _pbkdf2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2\n+.. _nist: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-132/nist-sp800-132.pdf\n+.. _bcrypt: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt\n+\n+\n+HTML5 Doctype\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+We've switched the admin and other bundled templates to use the HTML5\n+doctype. While Django will be careful to maintain compatibility with older\n+browsers, this change means that you can use any HTML5 features you need in\n+admin pages without having to lose HTML validity or override the provided\n+templates to change the doctype.\n+\n+List filters in admin interface\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Prior to Django 1.4, the :mod:`~django.contrib.admin` app allowed you to specify\n+change list filters by specifying a field lookup, but didn't allow you to create\n+custom filters. This has been rectified with a simple API (previously used\n+internally and known as \"FilterSpec\"). For more details, see the documentation\n+for :attr:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter`.\n+\n+Multiple sort in admin interface\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The admin change list now supports sorting on multiple columns. It respects all\n+elements of the :attr:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.ordering` attribute, and\n+sorting on multiple columns by clicking on headers is designed to mimic the\n+behavior of desktop GUIs. The\n+:meth:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_ordering` method for specifying the\n+ordering dynamically (e.g. depending on the request) has also been added.\n+\n+New ``ModelAdmin`` methods\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+A new :meth:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.save_related` method was added to\n+:mod:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin` to ease customization of how\n+related objects are saved in the admin.\n+\n+Two other new methods,\n+:meth:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_list_display` and\n+:meth:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_list_display_links`\n+were added to :class:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin` to enable the dynamic\n+customization of fields and links displayed on the admin change list.\n+\n+Admin inlines respect user permissions\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Admin inlines will now only allow those actions for which the user has\n+permission. For ``ManyToMany`` relationships with an auto-created intermediate\n+model (which does not have its own permissions), the change permission for the\n+related model determines if the user has the permission to add, change or\n+delete relationships.\n+\n+Tools for cryptographic signing\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 adds both a low-level API for signing values and a high-level API\n+for setting and reading signed cookies, one of the most common uses of\n+signing in Web applications.\n+\n+See the :doc:`cryptographic signing </topics/signing>` docs for more\n+information.\n+\n+Cookie-based session backend\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 introduces a new cookie-based backend for the session framework\n+which uses the tools for :doc:`cryptographic signing </topics/signing>` to\n+store the session data in the client's browser.\n+\n+See the :ref:`cookie-based session backend <cookie-session-backend>` docs for\n+more information.\n+\n+New form wizard\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The previous ``FormWizard`` from the formtools contrib app has been\n+replaced with a new implementation based on the class-based views\n+introduced in Django 1.3. It features a pluggable storage API and doesn't\n+require the wizard to pass around hidden fields for every previous step.\n+\n+Django 1.4 ships with a session-based storage backend and a cookie-based\n+storage backend. The latter uses the tools for\n+:doc:`cryptographic signing </topics/signing>` also introduced in\n+Django 1.4 to store the wizard's state in the user's cookies.\n+\n+See the :doc:`form wizard </ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard>` docs for\n+more information.\n+\n+``reverse_lazy``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+A lazily evaluated version of :func:`django.core.urlresolvers.reverse` was\n+added to allow using URL reversals before the project's URLConf gets loaded.\n+\n+Translating URL patterns\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 gained the ability to look for a language prefix in the URL pattern\n+when using the new :func:`~django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns` helper function.\n+Additionally, it's now possible to define translatable URL patterns using\n+:func:`~django.utils.translation.ugettext_lazy`. See\n+:ref:`url-internationalization` for more information about the language prefix\n+and how to internationalize URL patterns.\n+\n+Contextual translation support for ``{% trans %}`` and ``{% blocktrans %}``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The :ref:`contextual translation<contextual-markers>` support introduced in\n+Django 1.3 via the ``pgettext`` function has been extended to the\n+:ttag:`trans` and :ttag:`blocktrans` template tags using the new ``context``\n+keyword.\n+\n+Customizable ``SingleObjectMixin`` URLConf kwargs\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Two new attributes,\n+:attr:`pk_url_kwarg<django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin.pk_url_kwarg>`\n+and\n+:attr:`slug_url_kwarg<django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin.slug_url_kwarg>`,\n+have been added to :class:`~django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin` to\n+enable the customization of URLConf keyword arguments used for single\n+object generic views.\n+\n+Assignment template tags\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+A new :ref:`assignment_tag<howto-custom-template-tags-assignment-tags>` helper\n+function was added to ``template.Library`` to ease the creation of template\n+tags that store data in a specified context variable.\n+\n+``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` support for template tag helper functions\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The :ref:`simple_tag<howto-custom-template-tags-simple-tags>`,\n+:ref:`inclusion_tag <howto-custom-template-tags-inclusion-tags>` and\n+newly introduced\n+:ref:`assignment_tag<howto-custom-template-tags-assignment-tags>` template\n+helper functions may now accept any number of positional or keyword arguments.\n+For example:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    @register.simple_tag\n+    def my_tag(a, b, *args, **kwargs):\n+        warning = kwargs['warning']\n+        profile = kwargs['profile']\n+        ...\n+        return ...\n+\n+Then in the template any number of arguments may be passed to the template tag.\n+For example:\n+\n+.. code-block:: html+django\n+\n+    {% my_tag 123 \"abcd\" book.title warning=message|lower profile=user.profile %}\n+\n+No wrapping of exceptions in ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG`` mode\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+In previous versions of Django, whenever the :setting:`TEMPLATE_DEBUG` setting\n+was ``True``, any exception raised during template rendering (even exceptions\n+unrelated to template syntax) were wrapped in ``TemplateSyntaxError`` and\n+re-raised. This was done in order to provide detailed template source location\n+information in the debug 500 page.\n+\n+In Django 1.4, exceptions are no longer wrapped. Instead, the original\n+exception is annotated with the source information. This means that catching\n+exceptions from template rendering is now consistent regardless of the value of\n+:setting:`TEMPLATE_DEBUG`, and there's no need to catch and unwrap\n+``TemplateSyntaxError`` in order to catch other errors.\n+\n+``truncatechars`` template filter\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Added a filter which truncates a string to be no longer than the specified\n+number of characters. Truncated strings end with a translatable ellipsis\n+sequence (\"...\"). See the documentation for :tfilter:`truncatechars` for\n+more details.\n+\n+``static`` template tag\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The :mod:`staticfiles<django.contrib.staticfiles>` contrib app has a new\n+:ttag:`static<staticfiles-static>` template tag to refer to files saved with\n+the :setting:`STATICFILES_STORAGE` storage backend. It uses the storage\n+backend's ``url`` method and therefore supports advanced features such as\n+:ref:`serving files from a cloud service<staticfiles-from-cdn>`.\n+\n+``CachedStaticFilesStorage`` storage backend\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+In addition to the `static template tag`_, the\n+:mod:`staticfiles<django.contrib.staticfiles>` contrib app now has a\n+:class:`~django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.CachedStaticFilesStorage` backend\n+which caches the files it saves (when running the :djadmin:`collectstatic`\n+management command) by appending the MD5 hash of the file's content to the\n+filename. For example, the file ``css/styles.css`` would also be saved as\n+``css/styles.55e7cbb9ba48.css``\n+\n+See the :class:`~django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.CachedStaticFilesStorage`\n+docs for more information.\n+\n+Simple clickjacking protection\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+We've added a middleware to provide easy protection against `clickjacking\n+<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking>`_ using the ``X-Frame-Options``\n+header. It's not enabled by default for backwards compatibility reasons, but\n+you'll almost certainly want to :doc:`enable it </ref/clickjacking/>` to help\n+plug that security hole for browsers that support the header.\n+\n+CSRF improvements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+We've made various improvements to our CSRF features, including the\n+:func:`~django.views.decorators.csrf.ensure_csrf_cookie` decorator which can\n+help with AJAX heavy sites, protection for PUT and DELETE requests, and the\n+:setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` and :setting:`CSRF_COOKIE_PATH` settings which can\n+improve the security and usefulness of the CSRF protection. See the :doc:`CSRF\n+docs </ref/contrib/csrf>` for more information.\n+\n+Error report filtering\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Two new function decorators, :func:`sensitive_variables` and\n+:func:`sensitive_post_parameters`, were added to allow designating the\n+local variables and POST parameters which may contain sensitive\n+information and should be filtered out of error reports.\n+\n+All POST parameters are now systematically filtered out of error reports for\n+certain views (``login``, ``password_reset_confirm``, ``password_change``, and\n+``add_view`` in :mod:`django.contrib.auth.views`, as well as\n+``user_change_password`` in the admin app) to prevent the leaking of sensitive\n+information such as user passwords.\n+\n+You may override or customize the default filtering by writing a :ref:`custom\n+filter<custom-error-reports>`. For more information see the docs on\n+:ref:`Filtering error reports<filtering-error-reports>`.\n+\n+Extended IPv6 support\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The previously added support for IPv6 addresses when using the runserver\n+management command in Django 1.3 has now been further extended by adding\n+a :class:`~django.db.models.fields.GenericIPAddressField` model field,\n+a :class:`~django.forms.fields.GenericIPAddressField` form field and\n+the validators :data:`~django.core.validators.validate_ipv46_address` and\n+:data:`~django.core.validators.validate_ipv6_address`\n+\n+Updated default project layout and ``manage.py``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 ships with an updated default project layout and ``manage.py`` file\n+for the :djadmin:`startproject` management command. These fix some issues with\n+the previous ``manage.py`` handling of Python import paths that caused double\n+imports, trouble moving from development to deployment, and other\n+difficult-to-debug path issues.\n+\n+The previous ``manage.py`` called functions that are now deprecated, and thus\n+projects upgrading to Django 1.4 should update their ``manage.py``. (The\n+old-style ``manage.py`` will continue to work as before until Django 1.6; in\n+1.5 it will raise ``DeprecationWarning``).\n+\n+The new recommended ``manage.py`` file should look like this::\n+\n+    #!/usr/bin/env python\n+    import os, sys\n+\n+    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n+        os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"{{ project_name }}.settings\")\n+\n+        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\n+\n+        execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n+\n+``{{ project_name }}`` should be replaced with the Python package name of the\n+actual project.\n+\n+If settings, URLconfs, and apps within the project are imported or referenced\n+using the project name prefix (e.g. ``myproject.settings``, ``ROOT_URLCONF =\n+\"myproject.urls\"``, etc), the new ``manage.py`` will need to be moved one\n+directory up, so it is outside the project package rather than adjacent to\n+``settings.py`` and ``urls.py``.\n+\n+For instance, with the following layout::\n+\n+    manage.py\n+    mysite/\n+        __init__.py\n+        settings.py\n+        urls.py\n+        myapp/\n+            __init__.py\n+            models.py\n+\n+You could import ``mysite.settings``, ``mysite.urls``, and ``mysite.myapp``,\n+but not ``settings``, ``urls``, or ``myapp`` as top-level modules.\n+\n+Anything imported as a top-level module can be placed adjacent to the new\n+``manage.py``. For instance, to decouple \"myapp\" from the project module and\n+import it as just ``myapp``, place it outside the ``mysite/`` directory::\n+\n+    manage.py\n+    myapp/\n+        __init__.py\n+        models.py\n+    mysite/\n+        __init__.py\n+        settings.py\n+        urls.py\n+\n+If the same code is imported inconsistently (some places with the project\n+prefix, some places without it), the imports will need to be cleaned up when\n+switching to the new ``manage.py``.\n+\n+Improved WSGI support\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The :djadmin:`startproject` management command now adds a :file:`wsgi.py`\n+module to the initial project layout, containing a simple WSGI application that\n+can be used for :doc:`deploying with WSGI app\n+servers</howto/deployment/wsgi/index>`.\n+\n+The :djadmin:`built-in development server<runserver>` now supports using an\n+externally-defined WSGI callable, so as to make it possible to run runserver\n+with the same WSGI configuration that is used for deployment. A new\n+:setting:`WSGI_APPLICATION` setting is available to configure which WSGI\n+callable :djadmin:`runserver` uses.\n+\n+(The :djadmin:`runfcgi` management command also internally wraps the WSGI\n+callable configured via :setting:`WSGI_APPLICATION`.)\n+\n+Custom project and app templates\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The :djadmin:`startapp` and :djadmin:`startproject` management commands\n+got a ``--template`` option for specifying a path or URL to a custom app or\n+project template.\n+\n+For example, Django will use the ``/path/to/my_project_template`` directory\n+when running the following command::\n+\n+    django-admin.py startproject --template=/path/to/my_project_template myproject\n+\n+You can also now provide a destination directory as the second\n+argument to both :djadmin:`startapp` and :djadmin:`startproject`::\n+\n+    django-admin.py startapp myapp /path/to/new/app\n+    django-admin.py startproject myproject /path/to/new/project\n+\n+For more information, see the :djadmin:`startapp` and :djadmin:`startproject`\n+documentation.\n+\n+Support for time zones\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 adds :ref:`support for time zones <time-zones>`. When it's enabled,\n+Django stores date and time information in UTC in the database, uses time\n+zone-aware datetime objects internally, and translates them to the end user's\n+time zone in templates and forms.\n+\n+Reasons for using this feature include:\n+\n+- Customizing date and time display for users around the world.\n+- Storing datetimes in UTC for database portability and interoperability.\n+  (This argument doesn't apply to PostgreSQL, because it already stores\n+  timestamps with time zone information in Django 1.3.)\n+- Avoiding data corruption problems around DST transitions.\n+\n+Time zone support is enabled by default in new projects created with\n+:djadmin:`startproject`. If you want to use this feature in an existing\n+project, there is a :ref:`migration guide <time-zones-migration-guide>`.\n+\n+Minor features\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.4 also includes several smaller improvements worth noting:\n+\n+* A more usable stacktrace in the technical 500 page: frames in the\n+  stack trace which reference Django's code are dimmed out, while\n+  frames in user code are slightly emphasized. This change makes it\n+  easier to scan a stacktrace for issues in user code.\n+\n+* :doc:`Tablespace support </topics/db/tablespaces>` in PostgreSQL.\n+\n+* Customizable names for :meth:`~django.template.Library.simple_tag`.\n+\n+* In the documentation, a helpful :doc:`security overview </topics/security>`\n+  page.\n+\n+* The :func:`django.contrib.auth.models.check_password` function has been moved\n+  to the :mod:`django.contrib.auth.utils` module. Importing it from the old\n+  location will still work, but you should update your imports.\n+\n+* The :djadmin:`collectstatic` management command gained a ``--clear`` option\n+  to delete all files at the destination before copying or linking the static\n+  files.\n+\n+* It is now possible to load fixtures containing forward references when using\n+  MySQL with the InnoDB database engine.\n+\n+* A new 403 response handler has been added as\n+  ``'django.views.defaults.permission_denied'``. You can set your own handler by\n+  setting the value of :data:`django.conf.urls.handler403`. See the\n+  documentation about :ref:`the 403 (HTTP Forbidden) view<http_forbidden_view>`\n+  for more information.\n+\n+* The :ttag:`trans` template tag now takes an optional ``as`` argument to\n+  be able to retrieve a translation string without displaying it but setting\n+  a template context variable instead.\n+\n+* The :ttag:`if` template tag now supports ``{% elif %}`` clauses.\n+\n+* A new plain text version of the HTTP 500 status code internal error page\n+  served when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True`` is now sent to the client when\n+  Django detects that the request has originated in JavaScript code\n+  (:meth:`~django.http.HttpRequest.is_ajax` is used for this).\n+\n+  Similarly to its HTML counterpart, it contains a collection of different\n+  pieces of information about the state of the web application.\n+\n+  This should make it easier to read when debugging interaction with\n+  client-side Javascript code.\n+\n+* Added the :djadminopt:`--no-location` option to the :djadmin:`makemessages`\n+  command.\n+\n+* Changed the ``locmem`` cache backend to use\n+  ``pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL`` for better compatibility with the other\n+  cache backends.\n+\n+* Added support in the ORM for generating ``SELECT`` queries containing\n+  ``DISTINCT ON``.\n+\n+  The ``distinct()`` ``QuerySet`` method now accepts an optional list of model\n+  field names. If specified, then the ``DISTINCT`` statement is limited to these\n+  fields. This is only supported in PostgreSQL.\n+\n+  For more details, see the documentation for\n+  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.distinct`.\n+\n+* New phrases added to ``HIDDEN_SETTINGS`` regex in `django/views/debug.py`_.\n+\n+  ``'API'``, ``'TOKEN'``, ``'KEY'`` were added, ``'PASSWORD'`` was changed to \n+  ``'PASS'``.\n+\n+.. _django/views/debug.py: http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/views/debug.py\n+\n+\n+Backwards incompatible changes in 1.4\n+=====================================\n+\n+django.contrib.admin\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The included administration app ``django.contrib.admin`` has for a long time\n+shipped with a default set of static files such as JavaScript, images and\n+stylesheets. Django 1.3 added a new contrib app ``django.contrib.staticfiles``\n+to handle such files in a generic way and defined conventions for static\n+files included in apps.\n+\n+Starting in Django 1.4 the admin's static files also follow this\n+convention to make it easier to deploy the included files. In previous\n+versions of Django, it was also common to define an ``ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX``\n+setting to point to the URL where the admin's static files are served by a\n+web server. This setting has now been deprecated and replaced by the more\n+general setting :setting:`STATIC_URL`. Django will now expect to find the\n+admin static files under the URL ``<STATIC_URL>/admin/``.\n+\n+If you've previously used a URL path for ``ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX`` (e.g.\n+``/media/``) simply make sure :setting:`STATIC_URL` and :setting:`STATIC_ROOT`\n+are configured and your web server serves the files correctly. The development\n+server continues to serve the admin files just like before. Don't hesitate to\n+consult the :doc:`static files howto </howto/static-files>` for further\n+details.\n+\n+In case your ``ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX`` is set to an specific domain (e.g.\n+``http://media.example.com/admin/``) make sure to also set your\n+:setting:`STATIC_URL` setting to the correct URL, for example\n+``http://media.example.com/``.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    If you're implicitely relying on the path of the admin static files on\n+    your server's file system when you deploy your site, you have to update\n+    that path. The files were moved from :file:`django/contrib/admin/media/`\n+    to :file:`django/contrib/admin/static/admin/`.\n+\n+Supported browsers for the admin\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django hasn't had a clear policy on which browsers are supported for using the\n+admin app. Django's new policy formalizes existing practices: `YUI's A-grade`_\n+browsers should provide a fully-functional admin experience, with the notable\n+exception of IE6, which is no longer supported.\n+\n+Released over ten years ago, IE6 imposes many limitations on modern web\n+development. The practical implications of this policy are that contributors\n+are free to improve the admin without consideration for these limitations.\n+\n+This new policy **has no impact** on development outside of the admin. Users of\n+Django are free to develop webapps compatible with any range of browsers.\n+\n+.. _YUI's A-grade: http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tutorials/gbs/\n+\n+Removed admin icons\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+As part of an effort to improve the performance and usability of the admin's\n+changelist sorting interface and of the admin's :attr:`horizontal\n+<django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal>` and :attr:`vertical\n+<django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_vertical>` \"filter\" widgets, some icon\n+files were removed and grouped into two sprite files.\n+\n+Specifically: ``selector-add.gif``, ``selector-addall.gif``,\n+``selector-remove.gif``, ``selector-removeall.gif``,\n+``selector_stacked-add.gif`` and ``selector_stacked-remove.gif`` were\n+combined into ``selector-icons.gif``; and ``arrow-up.gif`` and\n+``arrow-down.gif`` were combined into ``sorting-icons.gif``.\n+\n+If you used those icons to customize the admin then you will want to replace\n+them with your own icons or retrieve them from a previous release.\n+\n+CSS class names in admin forms\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+To avoid conflicts with other common CSS class names (e.g. \"button\"), a prefix\n+\"field-\" has been added to all CSS class names automatically generated from the\n+form field names in the main admin forms, stacked inline forms and tabular\n+inline cells. You will need to take that prefix into account in your custom\n+style sheets or javascript files if you previously used plain field names as\n+selectors for custom styles or javascript transformations.\n+\n+Compatibility with old signed data\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.3 changed the cryptographic signing mechanisms used in a number of\n+places in Django. While Django 1.3 kept fallbacks that would accept hashes\n+produced by the previous methods, these fallbacks are removed in Django 1.4.\n+\n+So, if you upgrade to Django 1.4 directly from 1.2 or earlier, you may\n+lose/invalidate certain pieces of data that have been cryptographically signed\n+using an old method. To avoid this, use Django 1.3 first for a period of time\n+to allow the signed data to expire naturally. The affected parts are detailed\n+below, with 1) the consequences of ignoring this advice and 2) the amount of\n+time you need to run Django 1.3 for the data to expire or become irrelevant.\n+\n+* ``contrib.sessions`` data integrity check\n+\n+  * consequences: the user will be logged out, and session data will be lost.\n+\n+  * time period: defined by :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`.\n+\n+* ``contrib.auth`` password reset hash\n+\n+  * consequences: password reset links from before the upgrade will not work.\n+\n+  * time period: defined by :setting:`PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS`.\n+\n+Form-related hashes — these are much shorter lifetime, and are relevant only for\n+the short window where a user might fill in a form generated by the pre-upgrade\n+Django instance, and try to submit it to the upgraded Django instance:\n+\n+* ``contrib.comments`` form security hash\n+\n+  * consequences: the user will see a validation error \"Security hash failed\".\n+\n+  * time period: the amount of time you expect users to take filling out comment\n+    forms.\n+\n+* ``FormWizard`` security hash\n+\n+  * consequences: the user will see an error about the form having expired,\n+    and will be sent back to the first page of the wizard, losing the data\n+    they have entered so far.\n+\n+  * time period: the amount of time you expect users to take filling out the\n+    affected forms.\n+\n+* CSRF check\n+\n+  * Note: This is actually a Django 1.1 fallback, not Django 1.2,\n+    and applies only if you are upgrading from 1.1.\n+\n+  * consequences: the user will see a 403 error with any CSRF protected POST\n+    form.\n+\n+  * time period: the amount of time you expect user to take filling out\n+    such forms.\n+\n+django.contrib.flatpages\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Starting in the 1.4 release the\n+:class:`~django.contrib.flatpages.middleware.FlatpageFallbackMiddleware` only\n+adds a trailing slash and redirects if the resulting URL refers to an existing\n+flatpage. For example, requesting ``/notaflatpageoravalidurl`` in a previous\n+version would redirect to ``/notaflatpageoravalidurl/``, which would\n+subsequently raise a 404. Requesting ``/notaflatpageoravalidurl`` now will\n+immediately raise a 404. Additionally redirects returned by flatpages are now\n+permanent (301 status code) to match the behavior of the\n+:class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`.\n+\n+Serialization of :class:`~datetime.datetime` and :class:`~datetime.time`\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+As a consequence of time zone support, and according to the ECMA-262\n+specification, some changes were made to the JSON serializer:\n+\n+- It includes the time zone for aware datetime objects. It raises an exception\n+  for aware time objects.\n+- It includes milliseconds for datetime and time objects. There is still\n+  some precision loss, because Python stores microseconds (6 digits) and JSON\n+  only supports milliseconds (3 digits). However, it's better than discarding\n+  microseconds entirely.\n+\n+The XML serializer was also changed to use the ISO8601 format for datetimes.\n+The letter ``T`` is used to separate the date part from the time part, instead\n+of a space. Time zone information is included in the ``[+-]HH:MM`` format.\n+\n+The serializers will dump datetimes in fixtures with these new formats. They\n+can still load fixtures that use the old format.\n+\n+``supports_timezone`` changed to ``False`` for SQLite\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The database feature ``supports_timezone`` used to be ``True`` for SQLite.\n+Indeed, if you saved an aware datetime object, SQLite stored a string that\n+included an UTC offset. However, this offset was ignored when loading the value\n+back from the database, which could corrupt the data.\n+\n+In the context of time zone support, this flag was changed to ``False``, and\n+datetimes are now stored without time zone information in SQLite. When\n+:setting:`USE_TZ` is ``False``, if you attempt to save an aware datetime\n+object, Django raises an exception.\n+\n+Database connection's thread-locality\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+``DatabaseWrapper`` objects (i.e. the connection objects referenced by\n+``django.db.connection`` and ``django.db.connections[\"some_alias\"]``) used to\n+be thread-local. They are now global objects in order to be potentially shared\n+between multiple threads. While the individual connection objects are now\n+global, the ``django.db.connections`` dictionary referencing those objects is\n+still thread-local. Therefore if you just use the ORM or\n+``DatabaseWrapper.cursor()`` then the behavior is still the same as before.\n+Note, however, that ``django.db.connection`` does not directly reference the\n+default ``DatabaseWrapper`` object anymore and is now a proxy to access that\n+object's attributes. If you need to access the actual ``DatabaseWrapper``\n+object, use ``django.db.connections[DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS]`` instead.\n+\n+As part of this change, all underlying SQLite connections are now enabled for\n+potential thread-sharing (by passing the ``check_same_thread=False`` attribute\n+to pysqlite). ``DatabaseWrapper`` however preserves the previous behavior by\n+disabling thread-sharing by default, so this does not affect any existing\n+code that purely relies on the ORM or on ``DatabaseWrapper.cursor()``.\n+\n+Finally, while it is now possible to pass connections between threads, Django\n+does not make any effort to synchronize access to the underlying backend.\n+Concurrency behavior is defined by the underlying backend implementation.\n+Check their documentation for details.\n+\n+`COMMENTS_BANNED_USERS_GROUP` setting\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django's :doc:`comments app </ref/contrib/comments/index>` has historically\n+supported excluding the comments of a special user group, but we've never\n+documented the feature properly and didn't enforce the exclusion in other parts\n+of the app such as the template tags. To fix this problem, we removed the code\n+from the feed class.\n+\n+If you rely on the feature and want to restore the old behavior, simply use\n+a custom comment model manager to exclude the user group, like this::\n+\n+    from django.conf import settings\n+    from django.contrib.comments.managers import CommentManager\n+\n+    class BanningCommentManager(CommentManager):\n+        def get_query_set(self):\n+            qs = super(BanningCommentManager, self).get_query_set()\n+            if getattr(settings, 'COMMENTS_BANNED_USERS_GROUP', None):\n+                where = ['user_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM auth_user_groups WHERE group_id = %s)']\n+                params = [settings.COMMENTS_BANNED_USERS_GROUP]\n+                qs = qs.extra(where=where, params=params)\n+            return qs\n+\n+Save this model manager in your custom comment app (e.g. in\n+``my_comments_app/managers.py``) and add it your\n+:ref:`custom comment app model <custom-comment-app-api>`::\n+\n+    from django.db import models\n+    from django.contrib.comments.models import Comment\n+\n+    from my_comments_app.managers import BanningCommentManager\n+\n+    class CommentWithTitle(Comment):\n+        title = models.CharField(max_length=300)\n+\n+        objects = BanningCommentManager()\n+\n+For more details, see the documentation about\n+:doc:`customizing the comments framework </ref/contrib/comments/custom>`.\n+\n+`IGNORABLE_404_STARTS` and `IGNORABLE_404_ENDS` settings\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Until Django 1.3, it was possible to exclude some URLs from Django's\n+:doc:`404 error reporting</howto/error-reporting>` by adding prefixes to\n+:setting:`IGNORABLE_404_STARTS` and suffixes to :setting:`IGNORABLE_404_ENDS`.\n+\n+In Django 1.4, these two settings are superseded by\n+:setting:`IGNORABLE_404_URLS`, which is a list of compiled regular expressions.\n+Django won't send an email for 404 errors on URLs that match any of them.\n+\n+Furthermore, the previous settings had some rather arbitrary default values::\n+\n+    IGNORABLE_404_STARTS = ('/cgi-bin/', '/_vti_bin', '/_vti_inf')\n+    IGNORABLE_404_ENDS = ('mail.pl', 'mailform.pl', 'mail.cgi', 'mailform.cgi',\n+                          'favicon.ico', '.php')\n+\n+It's not Django's role to decide if your website has a legacy ``/cgi-bin/``\n+section or a ``favicon.ico``. As a consequence, the default values of\n+:setting:`IGNORABLE_404_URLS`, :setting:`IGNORABLE_404_STARTS` and\n+:setting:`IGNORABLE_404_ENDS` are all now empty.\n+\n+If you have customized :setting:`IGNORABLE_404_STARTS` or\n+:setting:`IGNORABLE_404_ENDS`, or if you want to keep the old default value,\n+you should add the following lines in your settings file::\n+\n+    import re\n+    IGNORABLE_404_URLS = (\n+        # for each <prefix> in IGNORABLE_404_STARTS\n+        re.compile(r'^<prefix>'),\n+        # for each <suffix> in IGNORABLE_404_ENDS\n+        re.compile(r'<suffix>$'),\n+    )\n+\n+Don't forget to escape characters that have a special meaning in a regular\n+expression.\n+\n+CSRF protection extended to PUT and DELETE\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Previously, Django's :doc:`CSRF protection </ref/contrib/csrf/>` provided\n+protection against only POST requests. Since use of PUT and DELETE methods in\n+AJAX applications is becoming more common, we now protect all methods not\n+defined as safe by :rfc:`2616` i.e. we exempt GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, and\n+enforce protection on everything else.\n+\n+If you are using PUT or DELETE methods in AJAX applications, please see the\n+:ref:`instructions about using AJAX and CSRF <csrf-ajax>`.\n+\n+``django.core.template_loaders``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+This was an alias to ``django.template.loader`` since 2005, it has been removed\n+without emitting a warning due to the length of the deprecation. If your code\n+still referenced this please use ``django.template.loader`` instead.\n+\n+``django.db.models.fields.URLField.verify_exists``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+This functionality has been removed due to intractable performance and\n+security issues. Any existing usage of ``verify_exists`` should be\n+removed.\n+\n+``django.core.files.storage.Storage.open``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The ``open`` method of the base Storage class took an obscure parameter\n+``mixin`` which allowed you to dynamically change the base classes of the\n+returned file object. This has been removed. In the rare case you relied on the\n+`mixin` parameter, you can easily achieve the same by overriding the `open`\n+method, e.g.::\n+\n+    from django.core.files import File\n+    from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage\n+\n+    class Spam(File):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        Spam, spam, spam, spam and spam.\n+        \"\"\"\n+        def ham(self):\n+            return 'eggs'\n+\n+    class SpamStorage(FileSystemStorage):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        A custom file storage backend.\n+        \"\"\"\n+        def open(self, name, mode='rb'):\n+            return Spam(open(self.path(name), mode))\n+\n+YAML deserializer now uses ``yaml.safe_load``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+``yaml.load`` is able to construct any Python object, which may trigger\n+arbitrary code execution if you process a YAML document that comes from an\n+untrusted source. This feature isn't necessary for Django's YAML deserializer,\n+whose primary use is to load fixtures consisting of simple objects. Even though\n+fixtures are trusted data, for additional security, the YAML deserializer now\n+uses ``yaml.safe_load``.\n+\n+Features deprecated in 1.4\n+==========================\n+\n+Old styles of calling ``cache_page`` decorator\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Some legacy ways of calling :func:`~django.views.decorators.cache.cache_page`\n+have been deprecated, please see the docs for the correct way to use this\n+decorator.\n+\n+Support for PostgreSQL versions older than 8.2\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Django 1.3 dropped support for PostgreSQL versions older than 8.0 and the\n+relevant documents suggested to use a recent version because of performance\n+reasons but more importantly because end of the upstream support periods for\n+releases 8.0 and 8.1 was near (November 2010).\n+\n+Django 1.4 takes that policy further and sets 8.2 as the minimum PostgreSQL\n+version it officially supports.\n+\n+Request exceptions are now always logged\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+When :doc:`logging support </topics/logging/>` was added to Django in 1.3, the\n+admin error email support was moved into the\n+:class:`django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler`, attached to the\n+``'django.request'`` logger. In order to maintain the established behavior of\n+error emails, the ``'django.request'`` logger was called only when\n+:setting:`DEBUG` was ``False``.\n+\n+To increase the flexibility of error logging for requests, the\n+``'django.request'`` logger is now called regardless of the value of\n+:setting:`DEBUG`, and the default settings file for new projects now includes a\n+separate filter attached to :class:`django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler` to\n+prevent admin error emails in ``DEBUG`` mode::\n+\n+   'filters': {\n+        'require_debug_false': {\n+            '()': 'django.utils.log.RequireDebugFalse'\n+        }\n+    },\n+    'handlers': {\n+        'mail_admins': {\n+            'level': 'ERROR',\n+            'filters': ['require_debug_false'],\n+            'class': 'django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler'\n+        }\n+    },\n+\n+If your project was created prior to this change, your :setting:`LOGGING`\n+setting will not include this new filter. In order to maintain\n+backwards-compatibility, Django will detect that your ``'mail_admins'`` handler\n+configuration includes no ``'filters'`` section, and will automatically add\n+this filter for you and issue a pending-deprecation warning. This will become a\n+deprecation warning in Django 1.5, and in Django 1.6 the\n+backwards-compatibility shim will be removed entirely.\n+\n+The existence of any ``'filters'`` key under the ``'mail_admins'`` handler will\n+disable this backward-compatibility shim and deprecation warning.\n+\n+``django.conf.urls.defaults``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Until Django 1.3 the functions :func:`~django.conf.urls.include`,\n+:func:`~django.conf.urls.patterns` and :func:`~django.conf.urls.url` plus\n+:data:`~django.conf.urls.handler404`, :data:`~django.conf.urls.handler500`\n+were located in a ``django.conf.urls.defaults`` module.\n+\n+Starting with Django 1.4 they are now available in :mod:`django.conf.urls`.\n+\n+``django.contrib.databrowse``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Databrowse has not seen active development for some time, and this does not show\n+any sign of changing. There had been a suggestion for a `GSOC project`_ to\n+integrate the functionality of databrowse into the admin, but no progress was\n+made. While Databrowse has been deprecated, an enhancement of\n+``django.contrib.admin`` providing a similar feature set is still possible.\n+\n+.. _GSOC project: https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SummerOfCode2011#Integratedatabrowseintotheadmin\n+\n+The code that powers Databrowse is licensed under the same terms as Django\n+itself, and so is available to be adopted by an individual or group as\n+a third-party project.\n+\n+``django.core.management.setup_environ``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+This function temporarily modified ``sys.path`` in order to make the parent\n+\"project\" directory importable under the old flat :djadmin:`startproject`\n+layout. This function is now deprecated, as its path workarounds are no longer\n+needed with the new ``manage.py`` and default project layout.\n+\n+This function was never documented or part of the public API, but was widely\n+recommended for use in setting up a \"Django environment\" for a user script.\n+These uses should be replaced by setting the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``\n+environment variable or using :func:`django.conf.settings.configure`.\n+\n+``django.core.management.execute_manager``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+This function was previously used by ``manage.py`` to execute a management\n+command. It is identical to\n+``django.core.management.execute_from_command_line``, except that it first\n+calls ``setup_environ``, which is now deprecated. As such, ``execute_manager``\n+is also deprecated; ``execute_from_command_line`` can be used instead. Neither\n+of these functions is documented as part of the public API, but a deprecation\n+path is needed due to use in existing ``manage.py`` files.\n+\n+``is_safe`` and ``needs_autoescape`` attributes of template filters\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Two flags, ``is_safe`` and ``needs_autoescape``, define how each template filter\n+interacts with Django's auto-escaping behavior. They used to be attributes of\n+the filter function::\n+\n+    @register.filter\n+    def noop(value):\n+        return value\n+    noop.is_safe = True\n+\n+However, this technique caused some problems in combination with decorators,\n+especially :func:`@stringfilter <django.template.defaultfilters.stringfilter>`.\n+Now, the flags are keyword arguments of :meth:`@register.filter\n+<django.template.Library.filter>`::\n+\n+    @register.filter(is_safe=True)\n+    def noop(value):\n+        return value\n+\n+See :ref:`filters and auto-escaping <filters-auto-escaping>` for more information.\n+\n+Session cookies now have the ``httponly`` flag by default\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Session cookies now include the ``httponly`` attribute by default to\n+help reduce the impact of potential XSS attacks. For strict backwards\n+compatibility, use ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False`` in your settings file.\n+\n+Wildcard expansion of application names in `INSTALLED_APPS`\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Until Django 1.3, :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` accepted wildcards in application\n+names, like ``django.contrib.*``. The expansion was performed by a\n+filesystem-based implementation of ``from <package> import *``. Unfortunately,\n+`this can't be done reliably`_.\n+\n+This behavior was never documented. Since it is un-pythonic and not obviously\n+useful, it was removed in Django 1.4. If you relied on it, you must edit your\n+settings file to list all your applications explicitly.\n+\n+.. _this can't be done reliably: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package\n+\n+``HttpRequest.raw_post_data`` renamed to ``HttpRequest.body``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+This attribute was confusingly named ``HttpRequest.raw_post_data``, but it\n+actually provided the body of the HTTP request. It's been renamed to\n+``HttpRequest.body``, and ``HttpRequest.raw_post_data`` has been deprecated.\n+\n+\n+The Django 1.4 roadmap\n+======================\n+\n+Before the final Django 1.4 release, several other preview/development releases\n+will be made available. The current schedule consists of at least the following:\n+\n+* Week of **January 30, 2012**: First Django 1.4 beta release; final\n+  feature freeze for Django 1.4.\n+\n+* Week of **February 27, 2012**: First Django 1.4 release\n+  candidate; string freeze for translations.\n+\n+* Week of **March 5, 2012**: Django 1.4 final release.\n+\n+If necessary, additional alpha, beta or release-candidate packages\n+will be issued prior to the final 1.4 release. Django 1.4 will be\n+released approximately one week after the final release candidate.\n+\n+What you can do to help\n+=======================\n+\n+In order to provide a high-quality 1.4 release, we need your help. Although this\n+beta release is, again, *not* intended for production use, you can help the\n+Django team by trying out the beta codebase in a safe test environment and\n+reporting any bugs or issues you encounter. The Django ticket tracker is the\n+central place to search for open issues:\n+\n+* http://code.djangoproject.com/timeline\n+\n+Please open new tickets if no existing ticket corresponds to a problem you're\n+running into.\n+\n+Additionally, discussion of Django development, including progress toward the\n+1.3 release, takes place daily on the django-developers mailing list:\n+\n+* http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers\n+\n+... and in the ``#django-dev`` IRC channel on ``irc.freenode.net``. If you're\n+interested in helping out with Django's development, feel free to join the\n+discussions there.\n+\n+Django's online documentation also includes pointers on how to contribute to\n+Django:\n+\n+* :doc:`How to contribute to Django </internals/contributing/index>`\n+\n+Contributions on any level -- developing code, writing documentation or simply\n+triaging tickets and helping to test proposed bugfixes -- are always welcome and\n+appreciated.\n+\n+Several development sprints will also be taking place before the 1.4\n+release; these will typically be announced in advance on the\n+django-developers mailing list, and anyone who wants to help is\n+welcome to join in."
