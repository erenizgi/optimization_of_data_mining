See the\n Backwards-incompatible changes in 1.3 alpha 2\n =============================================\n \n+Change to admin lookup filters\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The Django admin has long had an undocumented \"feature\" allowing savvy\n+users to manipulate the query string of changelist pages to filter the\n+list of objects displayed. However, this also creates a security\n+issue, as a staff user with sufficient knowledge of model structure\n+could use this \"feature\" to gain access to information he or she would\n+not normally have.\n+\n+As a result, changelist filtering now explicitly validates all lookup\n+arguments in the query string, and permits only fields which are\n+directly on the model, or relations explicitly permitted by the\n+``ModelAdmin`` definition. If you were relying on this undocumented\n+feature, you will need to update your ``ModelAdmin`` definitions to\n+whitelist the relations you choose to expose for filtering.\n+\n Introduction of STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT settings\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n "
