These files live in the top-level ``docs/`` directory of a\n+Django release.\n+\n+If you'd like to start contributing to our docs, get the development version of\n+Django from the source code repository\n+(see :ref:`installing-development-version`). The development version has the\n+latest-and-greatest documentation, just as it has latest-and-greatest code.\n+Generally, we only revise documentation in the development version, as our\n+policy is to freeze documentation for existing releases (see\n+:ref:`differences-between-doc-versions`).\n+\n Getting started with Sphinx\n ---------------------------\n "
