Note that even without CSRF, there are other vulnerabilities,\n such as session fixation, that make giving subdomains to untrusted parties a bad\n idea, and these vulnerabilities cannot easily be fixed with current browsers.\n \n+Edge cases\n+==========\n+\n+Certain views can have unusual requirements that mean they don't fit the normal\n+pattern envisaged here. A number of utilities can be useful in these\n+situations. The scenarios they might be needed in are described in the following\n+section.\n+\n+Utilities\n+---------\n+\n+.. module:: django.views.decorators.csrf\n+\n+.. function:: requires_csrf_token(view)\n+\n+    Normally the :ttag:`csrf_token` template tag will not work if\n+    ``CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view`` or an equivalent like ``csrf_protect``\n+    has not run. The view decorator ``requires_csrf_token`` can be used to\n+    ensure the template tag does work. This decorator works similarly to\n+    ``csrf_protect``, but never rejects an incoming request.\n+\n+    Example::\n+\n+        from django.views.decorators.csrf import requires_csrf_token\n+        from django.shortcuts import render\n+\n+        @requires_csrf_token\n+        def my_view(request):\n+            c = {}\n+            # ...\n+            return render(request, \"a_template.html\", c)\n+\n+Scenarios\n+---------\n+\n+CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view not used\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+There are cases when may not have run before your view is run - 404 and 500\n+handlers, for example - but you still need the CSRF token in a form.\n+\n+Solution: use ``requires_csrf_token``\n+\n+\n+Unprotected view needs the CSRF token\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+There may be some views that are unprotected and have been exempted by\n+``csrf_exempt``, but still need to include the CSRF token.\n+\n+Solution: use ``csrf_exempt`` followed by ``requires_csrf_token``.\n+\n+\n+\n Contrib and reusable apps\n =========================\n "
