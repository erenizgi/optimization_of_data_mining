These include:\n Backwards-incompatible changes in 1.3\n =====================================\n \n-CSRF exception for AJAX requests\n-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n-\n-Django includes a CSRF-protection mechanism, which makes use of a\n-token inserted into outgoing forms. Middleware then checks for the\n-token's presence on form submission, and validates it.\n-\n-Prior to Django 1.2.5, our CSRF protection made an exception for AJAX\n-requests, on the following basis:\n+CSRF validation now applies to AJAX requests\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n \n-    * Many AJAX toolkits add an X-Requested-With header when using\n-      XMLHttpRequest.\n-\n-    * Browsers have strict same-origin policies regarding\n-      XMLHttpRequest.\n-\n-    * In the context of a browser, the only way that a custom header\n-      of this nature can be added is with XMLHttpRequest.\n-\n-Therefore, for ease of use, we did not apply CSRF checks to requests\n-that appeared to be AJAX on the basis of the X-Requested-With header.\n-The Ruby on Rails web framework had a similar exemption.\n-\n-Recently, engineers at Google made members of the Ruby on Rails\n-development team aware of a combination of browser plugins and\n-redirects which can allow an attacker to provide custom HTTP headers\n-on a request to any website. This can allow a forged request to appear\n-to be an AJAX request, thereby defeating CSRF protection which trusts\n-the same-origin nature of AJAX requests.\n-\n-Michael Koziarski of the Rails team brought this to our attention, and\n-we were able to produce a proof-of-concept demonstrating the same\n-vulnerability in Django's CSRF handling.\n-\n-To remedy this, Django will now apply full CSRF validation to all\n-requests, regardless of apparent AJAX origin. This is technically\n-backwards-incompatible, but the security risks have been judged to\n-outweigh the compatibility concerns in this case.\n-\n-Additionally, Django will now accept the CSRF token in the custom HTTP\n-header X-CSRFTOKEN, as well as in the form submission itself, for ease\n-of use with popular JavaScript toolkits which allow insertion of\n-custom headers into all AJAX requests.\n-\n-Please see the :ref:`CSRF docs for example jQuery code <csrf-ajax>`\n-that demonstrates this technique, ensuring that you are looking at the\n-documentation for your version of Django, as the exact code necessary\n-is different for some older versions of Django.\n+Prior to Django 1.2.5, Django's CSRF-prevention system exempted AJAX\n+requests from CSRF verification; due to `security issues`_ reported to\n+us, however, *all* requests are now subjected to CSRF\n+verification. Consult :ref:`the Django CSRF documentation\n+<ref/contrib/csrf>` for details on how to handle CSRF verification in\n+AJAX requests.\n \n Restricted filters in admin interface\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n \n-The Django administrative interface, django.contrib.admin, supports\n-filtering of displayed lists of objects by fields on the corresponding\n-models, including across database-level relationships. This is\n-implemented by passing lookup arguments in the querystring portion of\n-the URL, and options on the ModelAdmin class allow developers to\n-specify particular fields or relationships which will generate\n-automatic links for filtering.\n-\n-One historically-undocumented and -unofficially-supported feature has\n-been the ability for a user with sufficient knowledge of a model's\n-structure and the format of these lookup arguments to invent useful\n-new filters on the fly by manipulating the querystring.\n-\n-However, it has been demonstrated that this can be abused to gain\n-access to information outside of an admin user's permissions; for\n-example, an attacker with access to the admin and sufficient knowledge\n-of model structure and relations could construct query strings which --\n-with repeated use of regular-expression lookups supported by the\n-Django database API -- expose sensitive information such as users'\n-password hashes.\n-\n-To remedy this, django.contrib.admin will now validate that\n-querystring lookup arguments either specify only fields on the model\n-being viewed, or cross relations which have been explicitly\n-whitelisted by the application developer using the pre-existing\n-mechanism mentioned above. This is backwards-incompatible for any\n-users relying on the prior ability to insert arbitrary lookups.\n+Prior to Django 1.2.5, the Django administrative interface allowed\n+filtering on any model field or relation -- not just those specified\n+in ``list_filter`` -- via query string manipulation. Due to `security\n+issues`_ reported to us, however, query string lookup arguments in the\n+admin must be for fields or relations specified in ``list_filter`` or\n+``date_hierarchy``.\n \n FileField no longer deletes files\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n@@ -448,10 +427,10 @@ list of profanities, preventing people from submitting comments that\n contained one of those profanities.\n \n Unfortunately, the technique used to implement this profanities list\n-was woefully naive, and prone to the `Scunthorpe problem`_.
