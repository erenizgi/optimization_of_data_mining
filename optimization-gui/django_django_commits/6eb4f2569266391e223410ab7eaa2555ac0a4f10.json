This document is no longer\n-    maintained since an official API for customizing the Django admin interface\n-    is in development.\n-\n-Django's dynamic admin interface gives you a fully-functional admin for free\n-with no hand-coding required. The dynamic admin is designed to be\n-production-ready, not just a starting point, so you can use it as-is on a real\n-site. While the underlying format of the admin pages is built in to Django, you\n-can customize the look and feel by editing the admin stylesheet and images.\n-\n-Here's a quick and dirty overview some of the main styles and classes used in\n-the Django admin CSS.\n-\n-Modules\n-=======\n-\n-The ``.module`` class is a basic building block for grouping content in the\n-admin. It's generally applied to a ``div`` or a ``fieldset``. It wraps the content\n-group in a box and applies certain styles to the elements within. An ``h2``\n-within a ``div.module`` will align to the top of the ``div`` as a header for the\n-whole group.\n-\n-.. image:: _images/module.png\n-   :alt: Example use of module class on admin homepage\n-\n-Column Types\n-============\n-\n-.. note::\n-\n-    All admin pages (except the dashboard) are fluid-width. All fixed-width\n-    classes from previous Django versions have been removed.\n-\n-The base template for each admin page has a block that defines the column\n-structure for the page. This sets a class on the page content area\n-(``div#content``) so everything on the page knows how wide it should be. There\n-are three column types available.\n-\n-colM\n-    This is the default column setting for all pages. The \"M\" stands for \"main\".\n-    Assumes that all content on the page is in one main column\n-    (``div#content-main``).\n-colMS\n-    This is for pages with one main column and a sidebar on the right. The \"S\"\n-    stands for \"sidebar\". Assumes that main content is in ``div#content-main``\n-    and sidebar content is in ``div#content-related``. This is used on the main\n-    admin page.\n-colSM\n-    Same as above, with the sidebar on the left. The source order of the columns\n-    doesn't matter.\n-\n-For instance, you could stick this in a template to make a two-column page with\n-the sidebar on the right:\n-\n-.. code-block:: html+django\n-\n-    {% block coltype %}colMS{% endblock %}\n-\n-Text Styles\n-===========\n-\n-Font Sizes\n-----------\n-\n-Most HTML elements (headers, lists, etc.) have base font sizes in the stylesheet\n-based on context. There are three classes are available for forcing text to a\n-certain size in any context.\n-\n-small\n-    11px\n-tiny\n-    10px\n-mini\n-    9px (use sparingly)\n-\n-Font Styles and Alignment\n--------------------------\n-\n-There are also a few styles for styling text.\n-\n-.quiet\n-    Sets font color to light gray. Good for side notes in instructions. Combine\n-    with ``.small`` or ``.tiny`` for sheer excitement.\n-.help\n-    This is a custom class for blocks of inline help text explaining the\n-    function of form elements. It makes text smaller and gray, and when applied\n-    to ``p`` elements within ``.form-row`` elements (see Form Styles below),\n-    it will offset the text to align with the form field. Use this for help\n-    text, instead of ``small quiet``. It works on other elements, but try to\n-    put the class on a ``p`` whenever you can.\n-.align-left\n-    It aligns the text left. Only works on block elements containing inline\n-    elements.\n-.align-right\n-    Are you paying attention?\n-.nowrap\n-    Keeps text and inline objects from wrapping. Comes in handy for table\n-    headers you want to stay on one line.\n-\n-Floats and Clears\n------------------\n-\n-float-left\n-    floats left\n-float-right\n-    floats right\n-clear\n-    clears all\n-\n-Object Tools\n-============\n-\n-Certain actions which apply directly to an object are used in form and\n-changelist pages. These appear in a \"toolbar\" row above the form or changelist,\n-to the right of the page. The tools are wrapped in a ``ul`` with the class\n-``object-tools``. There are two custom tool types which can be defined with an\n-additional class on the ``a`` for that tool. These are ``.addlink`` and\n-``.viewsitelink``.\n-\n-Example from a changelist page:\n-\n-.. code-block:: html+django\n-\n-    <ul class=\"object-tools\">\n-      <li><a href=\"/stories/add/\" class=\"addlink\">Add redirect</a></li>\n-    </ul>\n-\n-.. image:: _images/objecttools_01.png\n-   :alt: Object tools on a changelist page\n-\n-and from a form page:\n-\n-.. code-block:: html+django\n-\n-    <ul class=\"object-tools\">\n-     <li><a href=\"/history/303/152383/\">History</a></li>\n-     <li><a href=\"/r/303/152383/\" class=\"viewsitelink\">View on site</a></li>\n-    </ul>\n-\n-.. image:: _images/objecttools_02.png\n-   :alt: Object tools on a form page\n-\n-Form Styles\n-===========\n-\n-Fieldsets\n----------\n-\n-Admin forms are broken up into groups by ``fieldset`` elements. Each form fieldset\n-should have a class ``.module``. Each fieldset should have a header ``h2`` within the\n-fieldset at the top (except the first group in the form, and in some cases where the\n-group of fields doesn't have a logical label).\n-\n-Each fieldset can also take extra classes in addition to ``.module`` to apply\n-appropriate formatting to the group of fields.\n-\n-.aligned\n-    This will align the labels and inputs side by side on the same line.\n-.wide\n-    Used in combination with ``.aligned`` to widen the space available for the\n-    labels.\n-\n-Form Rows\n----------\n-\n-Each row of the form (within the ``fieldset``) should be enclosed in a ``div``\n-with class ``form-row``. If the field in the row is required, a class of\n-``required`` should also be added to the ``div.form-row``.\n-\n-.. image:: _images/formrow.png\n-   :alt: Example use of form-row class\n-\n-Labels\n-------\n-\n-Form labels should always precede the field, except in the case\n-of checkboxes and radio buttons, where the ``input`` should come first. Any\n-explanation or help text should follow the ``label`` in a ``p`` with class\n-``.help``."
