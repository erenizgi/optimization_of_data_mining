It shows which\n+parts of your code are being exercised by tests and which are not. It's an\n+important part of testing applications, so it's strongly recommended to check\n+the coverage of your tests.\n+\n+Django can be easily integrated with `coverage.py`_, a tool for measuring code\n+coverage of Python programs. First, `install coverage.py`_. Next, run the\n+following from your project folder containing ``manage.py``::\n+\n+   coverage run --source='.' manage.py test myapp\n+\n+This runs your tests and collects coverage data of the executed files in your\n+project. You can see a report of this data by typing following command::\n+\n+   coverage report\n+\n+Note that some Django code was executed while running tests, but it is not\n+listed here because of the ``source`` flag passed to the previous command.\n+\n+For more options like annotated HTML listings detailing missed lines, see the\n+`coverage.py`_ docs.\n+\n+.. _coverage.py: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/\n+.. _install coverage.py: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage\n+\n Testing tools\n =============\n "
