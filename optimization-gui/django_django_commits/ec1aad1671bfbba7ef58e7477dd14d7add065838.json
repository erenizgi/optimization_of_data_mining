Among other advantages it\n+would allow evolution of the URL design without having to go all over the\n+project source code to search and replace outdated URLs.\n+\n+The piece of information we have available as a starting point to get a URL is\n+an identification (e.g. the name) of the view in charge of handling it, other\n+pieces of information that necessarily must participate in the lookup of the\n+right URL are the types (positional, keyword) and values of the view arguments.\n+\n+Django provides a solution such that the URL mapper is the only repository of\n+the URL design. You feed it with your URLconf and then it can be used in both\n+directions:\n+\n+* Starting with a URL requested by the user/browser, it calls the right Django\n+  view providing any arguments it might need with their values as extracted from\n+  the URL.\n+\n+* Starting with the identification of the corresponding Django view plus the\n+  values of arguments that would be passed to it, obtain the associated URL.\n+\n+The first one is the usage we've been discussing in the previous sections. The\n+second one is what is known as *reverse resolution of URLs*, *reverse URL\n+matching*, *reverse URL lookup*, or simply *URL reversing*.\n+\n+Django provides tools for performing URL reversing that match the different\n+layers where URLs are needed:\n+\n+* In templates: Using the :ttag:`url` template tag.\n+\n+* In Python code: Using the :func:`django.core.urlresolvers.reverse()`\n+  function.\n+\n+* In higher level code related to handling of URLs of Django model instances:\n+  The :meth:`django.db.models.Model.get_absolute_url()` method and the\n+  :func:`django.db.models.permalink` decorator.\n+\n+Examples\n+--------\n+\n+Consider again this URLconf entry::\n+\n+    from django.conf.urls import patterns, url\n+\n+    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n+\t#...\n+        url(r'^articles/(\\d{4})/$', 'news.views.year_archive'),\n+\t#...\n+    )\n+\n+According to this design, the URL for the archive corresponding to year *nnnn*\n+is ``/articles/nnnn/``.\n+\n+You can obtain these in template code by using:\n+\n+.. code-block:: html+django\n+\n+    <a href=\"{% url 'news.views.year_archive' 2012 %}\">2012 Archive</a>\n+    {# Or with the year in a template context variable: #}\n+    <ul>\n+    {% for yearvar in year_list %}\n+    <li><a href=\"{% url 'news.views.year_archive' yearvar %}\">{{ yearvar }} Archive</a></li>\n+    {% endfor %}\n+    </ul>\n+\n+Or in Python code::\n+\n+    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse\n+    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\n+\n+    def redirect_to_year(request):\n+        # ...\n+        year = 2006\n+        # ...\n+        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('new.views.year_archive', args=(year,)))\n+\n+If, for some reason, it was decided that the URL where content for yearly\n+article archives are published at should be changed then you would only need to\n+change the entry in the URLconf.\n+\n+In some scenarios where views are of a generic nature, a many-to-one\n+relationship might exist between URLs and views.
