Static assets should now go in ``static/`` subdirectories of your apps\n-or in \"project-wide\" static directories listed in :setting:`STATICFILES_DIRS`,\n+or in other static assets directories listed in :setting:`STATICFILES_DIRS`,\n and will be served at :setting:`STATIC_URL`.\n \n See the :doc:`reference documentation of the app </ref/contrib/staticfiles>`"
