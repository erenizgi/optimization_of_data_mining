Import the data from `medical_examination.csv` and assign it to the `df` variable\n+1. Import the data from `medical_examination.csv` and assign it to the `df` variable.\n 2. Add an `overweight` column to the data. To determine if a person is overweight, first calculate their BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. If that value is > 25 then the person is overweight. Use the value `0` for NOT overweight and the value `1` for overweight.\n 3. Normalize data by making `0` always good and `1` always bad. If the value of `cholesterol` or `gluc` is 1, set the value to `0`. If the value is more than `1`, set the value to `1`.\n-4. Draw the Categorical Plot in the `draw_cat_plot` function\n+4. Draw the Categorical Plot in the `draw_cat_plot` function.\n 5. Create a DataFrame for the cat plot using `pd.melt` with values from `cholesterol`, `gluc`, `smoke`, `alco`, `active`, and `overweight` in the `df_cat` variable.\n 6. Group and reformat the data in `df_cat` to split it by `cardio`. Show the counts of each feature. You will have to rename one of the columns for the `catplot` to work correctly.\n-7. Convert the data into `long` format and create a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features using the following method provided by the seaborn library import : `sns.catplot()`\n-8.
