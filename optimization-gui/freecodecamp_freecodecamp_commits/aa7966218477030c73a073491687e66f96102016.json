You can only use the `aria-haspopup` attribute when the pop-up has one of the following roles: `menu`, `listbox`, `tree`, `grid`, or `dialog`. The value of `aria-haspopup` must be either one of these roles or `true`, which is the same as `menu`.\n+- **`aria-checked` attribute**: This attribute is used to indicate whether an element is in the checked state. It is most commonly used when creating custom checkboxes, radio buttons, switches, and listboxes.\n+- **`aria-disabled` attribute**: This state is used to indicate that an element is disabled only to people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers.\n+- **`aria-selected` attribute**: This state is used to indicate that an element is selected. You can use this state on custom controls like a tabbed interface, a listbox, or a grid.\n+- **`aria-controls` attribute**: Used to associate an element with another element that it controls. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the relationship between the elements.\n+- **`hidden` attribute**: Hides inactive panels from both visual and assistive technology users.\n+\n+### Working with Live Regions and Dynamic Content\n+\n+- **`aria-live` attribute**: Makes part of a webpage a live region, meaning any updates inside that area will be announced by a screen reader so users don't miss important changes.\n+- **`polite` value**: Most live regions use this value. This value means that the update is not urgent, so the screen reader can wait until it finishes any current announcement or the user completes their current action before announcing the update.\n+\n+Here is an example of a live region that is dynamically updated by JavaScript:\n+\n+```html\n+<div aria-live=\"polite\" id=\"status\"></div>\n+```\n+\n+```js\n+const statusEl = document.getElementById(\"status\");\n+statusEl.textContent = \"Your file has been successfully uploaded.\";\n+```\n+\n+- **`contenteditable` attribute**: Turns the element into a live editor, allowing users to update its content as if it were a text field.
