You should define a class named `BankAccount` with a constructor. The constructor should set the default `balance` to `0` and initialize an empty array named `transactions` to store transaction records as objects. \n+\n+2. Each transaction stored in the `transactions` array should be an object with two properties: `type` and `amount`. The `type` property should be either `deposit` or `withdraw`, and the `amount` property should be the amount deposited or withdrawn.\n+\n+3. You should define a method named `deposit` that takes the deposit amount as a parameter. When the deposit amount is greater than `0`, it should:\n+\n+   - Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of `deposit` and the amount deposited.\n+   - Update the balance.   \n+   - Return `\"Successfully deposited $[amount]. New balance: $[balance]\"`.\n+\n+4. If the amount is less than or equal to `0`, the `deposit` method should return `\"Deposit amount must be greater than zero.\"`.\n+\n+5. You should define a method named `withdraw` that takes an amount as a parameter. This method should update the current balance according to withdrawals. When the amount to be withdrawn is greater than `0` and less than or equal to the current balance, it should:\n+\n+   - Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of `withdraw` and the amount withdrawn.\n+   - Update the balance.\n+   - Return `\"Successfully withdrew $[amount]. New balance: $[balance]\"`. \n+\n+6. If the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to `0` or greater than the current balance, the `withdraw` method should return `\"Insufficient balance or invalid amount.\"`.\n+\n+\n+7. You should define a method named `checkBalance` that returns the current balance in the format `\"Current balance: $[balance]\"`.\n+\n+8. You should define a method named `listAllDeposits` that iterates through the transactions array and returns all deposits in the format `\"Deposits: amount,amount,...\"`.\n+\n+9. You should define a method named `listAllWithdrawals` that iterates through the transactions array and returns all withdrawals in the format `\"Withdrawals: amount,amount,...\"`.\n+\n+10. You should create a new instance of `BankAccount` named `myAccount`.\n+\n+11. Your `myAccount` bank account should have at least five transactions.\n+\n+12. Your `myAccount` bank account should have at least two deposits.\n+\n+13. Your `myAccount` bank account should have at least two withdrawals.\n+\n+14.
