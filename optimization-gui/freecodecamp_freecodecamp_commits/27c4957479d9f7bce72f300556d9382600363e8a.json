The programming languages and tools they use are secondary to this fundamental skill.\n+\n+From his book, \"Think Like a Programmer\", V. Anton Spraul defines problem solving in programming as:\n+\n+> Problem solving is writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints.\n+\n+The set of tasks can range from solving small coding exercises all the way up to building a social network site like Facebook or a search engine like Google. Each problem has its own set of constraints, for example, high performance and scalability may not matter too much in a coding exercise but it will be vital in apps like Google that need to service billions of search queries each day.\n+\n+New programmers often find problem solving the hardest skill to build. It's not uncommon for budding programmers to breeze through learning syntax and programming concepts, yet when trying to code something on their own, they find themselves staring blankly at their text editor not knowing where to start.\n+\n+The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by making lots and lots of programs.

When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.\n+\n+### Plan\n+Now that you know what you’re aiming to solve, don’t jump into coding just yet. It’s time to plan out how you’re going to solve it first. Some of the questions you should answer at this stage of the process:\n+\n+- Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.\n+\n+- What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?\n+\n+- What’s the desired output?\n+\n+- Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?\n+\n+The last question is where you will write out an algorithm to solve the problem.

In technical terms, this is called <dfn>throwing</dfn> an error. The first part of an error displays the type of error. This provides the first clue as to what you're dealing with. You'll learn more about the different error types later in the lesson. In this example, you have a `ReferenceError`.\n+\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/175b5ef2a1b4758a7b75f4ef43d7e27203e5707b/foundations/javascript_basics/understanding_errors/imgs/00.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"An error being displayed in the developer console\"/>\n+\n+A `ReferenceError` is thrown when one refers to a variable that is not declared and/or initialized within the current scope. In our case, the error message explains that the error has occurred because `c is not defined`.\n+\n+Different errors of this type have different messages based on what is causing the `ReferenceError`. For example, another message you may run into is `ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'X' before initialization`.\n+\n+The next part of an error gives us the name of the file in which you can find the error (in this case, our `script.js`), and also the line number.\n+\n+This allows you to easily navigate to the problematic line in your code. Here, the error originates from the fourth line of `script.js`, which is displayed as a link under the error message with the text at `script.js:4`. If you click this link, most browsers will navigate to the exact line of code and the rest of your script in the Sources tab of the Developer Tools.\n+\n+Sometimes your browser’s console will also display the column (or character) in the line at which the error is occurring.
