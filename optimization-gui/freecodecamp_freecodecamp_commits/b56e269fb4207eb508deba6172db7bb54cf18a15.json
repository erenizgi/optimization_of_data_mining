Unlike a traditional loop, recursion allows you to handle something with an unknown depth, such as deeply nested objects/arrays, or a file tree. But you can also use it for more basic tasks, such as counting down from a given number.\n \n-Let’s construct a function to do exactly that. We’ll call our function recursiveCountdown, and it needs to accept a number. We’ll have it print this number to the console:\n+Let's construct a function to do exactly that.
