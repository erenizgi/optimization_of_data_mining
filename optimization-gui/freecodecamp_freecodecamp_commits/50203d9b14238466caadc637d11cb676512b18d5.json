Think of it like a grammar mistake in a sentence.\n+\n+```js\n+const arr = [\"Beau\", \"Quincy\" \"Tom\"]\n+```\n+\n+- **ReferenceError**: There are several types of Reference Errors, triggered in different ways. The first type of reference error would be not defined variables. Another example of a ReferenceError is trying to access a variable, declared with `let` or `const`, before it has been defined.\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(num);\n+const num = 50;\n+```\n+\n+- **TypeError**: These errors occur when you try to perform an operation on the wrong type.\n+\n+```js\n+const developerObj = {\n+  name: \"Jessica\",\n+  country: \"USA\",\n+  isEmployed: true\n+};\n+\n+developerObj.map()\n+```\n+\n+- **RangeError**: These errors happen when your code tries to use a value that’s outside the range of what JavaScript can handle. \n+\n+```js\n+const arr = [];\n+arr.length = -1; \n+```\n+\n+## The `throw` Statement \n+\n+- **Definition**: The `throw` statement in JavaScript is used to throw a user defined exception. An exception in programming, is when an unexpected event happens and disrupts the normal flow of the program.\n+\n+```js\n+function validateNumber(input) {\n+  if (typeof input !== \"number\") {\n+    throw new TypeError(\"Expected a number, but received \" + typeof input);\n+  }\n+  return input * 2;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## `try...catch...finally`\n+\n+- **Definition**: The `try` block is used to wrap code that might throw an error. It acts as a safe space to try something that could fail. The `catch` block captures and handles errors that occur in the try block. You can use the error object inside catch to inspect what went wrong. The `finally` block runs after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an error occurred. It’s commonly used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n+\n+```js\n+function processInput(input) {\n+  if (typeof input !== \"string\") {\n+    throw new TypeError(\"Input must be a string.\");\n+  }\n+\n+  return input.toUpperCase();\n+}\n+\n+try {\n+  console.log(\"Starting to process input...\");\n+  const result = processInput(9);\n+  console.log(\"Processed result:\", result);\n+} catch (error) {\n+  console.error(\"Error occurred:\", error.message);\n+} \n+```\n+\n+## Debugging Techniques \n+\n+- **`debugger` Statement**: This statement lets you pause your code at a specific line to investigate what's going on in the program.\n+\n+```js\n+let firstNumber = 5;\n+let secondNumber = 10;\n+\n+debugger; // Code execution pauses here\n+let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;\n+\n+console.log(sum);\n+```\n+\n+- **Breakpoints**: Breakpoints let you pause the execution of your code at a specific line of your choice. After the pause, you can inspect variables, evaluate expressions, and examine the call stack.\n+- **Watchers**: Watch expressions lets you monitor the values of variables or expressions as the code runs even if they are out of the current scope.\n+- **Profiling**: Profiling helps you identify performance bottlenecks by letting you capture screenshots and record CPU usage, function calls, and execution time.\n+- **`console.dir()`**: This method is used to display an interactive list of the properties of a specified JavaScript object. It outputs a hierarchical listing that can be expanded to see all nested properties.\n+\n+```js\n+console.dir(document);\n+```\n+\n+- **`console.table()`**: This method displays tabular data as a table in the console. It takes one mandatory argument, which must be an array or an object, and one optional argument to specify which properties (columns) to display.\n \n # --assignment--\n "
