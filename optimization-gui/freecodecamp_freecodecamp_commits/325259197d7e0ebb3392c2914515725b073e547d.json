If these conditions are true, the corresponding styles are applied.

This approach has gained significant traction in recent years, becoming a cornerstone of modern web development practices.\n \n At its core, the mobile-first approach involves designing and developing the mobile version of a website as the primary step. This version serves as the foundation, which is then progressively enhanced for larger screens and devices with more capabilities. This methodology stands in contrast to the traditional approach, where websites were initially designed for desktop computers and subsequently scaled down or modified to fit smaller screens."
