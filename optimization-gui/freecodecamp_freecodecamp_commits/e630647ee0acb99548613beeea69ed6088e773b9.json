We then use media queries with `min-width` to add or modify styles for larger screens. This exemplifies the essence of mobile-first design in CSS: beginning with styles for the smallest screens and then progressively enhancing for larger ones.\n \n The mobile-first approach also aligns well with search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. Google, for instance, uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it predominantly uses the mobile version of the content for indexing and ranking."
