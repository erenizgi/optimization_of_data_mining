In the case of input elements your ability to style them with CSS can feel rather restricted. So, you may want to use `appearance: none` to hide aspects of the default element and build your own instead. For example, this would hide the default checkboxes for a checkbox input allowing you to use custom indicators like a green tick and a red X to show the state. For a search input, WebKit based browsers will show a default search icon and a cancel button. Hiding these allows you to create your own indicators that would appear on all browsers. "
