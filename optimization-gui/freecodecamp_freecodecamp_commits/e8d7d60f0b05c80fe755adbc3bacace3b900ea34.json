You can use a boolean to represent a condition, such as `isLoggedin = true`.\n-- **Undefined and Null**: An undefined value is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

The key is the property name, and the value is the property value.\n \n Here, the `pet` object has three properties or keys: `name`, `age`, and `type`.

The `+` operator is one of the simplest and most frequently used methods to concatenate strings. \n \n ```js\n-let studentName = 'Asad';\n+let studentName = \"Asad\";\n let studentAge = 25;\n-let studentInfo = studentName + ' is ' + studentAge + ' years old.';\n+let studentInfo = studentName + \" is \" + studentAge + \" years old.\";\n console.log(studentInfo); // Asad is 25 years old.\n ```\n \n - If you need to add or append to an existing string, then you can use the  `+=` operator. This is helpful when you want to build upon a string by adding more text to it over time.\n \n ```js\n-let message = 'Welcome to programming, ';\n-message += 'Asad!';\n+let message = \"Welcome to programming, \";\n+message += \"Asad!\";\n console.log(message); // Welcome to programming, Asad!\n ```\n \n-- Another way you can concatenate strings is to use the concat method.
