It allows you to define a key that focuses on or activates a particular element.\n+\n+Here is an interactive example you can try out following the suggestions below:\n \n - `accesskey=\"s\"` assigns the key `S` to the `Save` button. On most browsers, pressing `ALT + S` (on Windows) and `CTRL + Option + S` (on Mac) will activate this button.\n - `accesskey=\"c\"` sets the key `C` to the `Cancel` button, allowing users to activate it using `ALT + C` (Windows) and `CTRL + Option + C` (Mac).\n - `accesskey=\"h\"` assigns the key `H` to the `Home` link, allowing users to navigate to the homepage using `ALT + H` (Windows) and `CTRL + Option + H` (Mac).\n \n Please note that the exact key combination to activate the accesskey might vary depending on the browser and operating system.

If you feel the default browser focus indicator is not enough, you can override it by targeting the focus state of the element.\n \n-Here is an example of styling the focus state for an HTML element:\n+Here is an example of styling the focus state for a `button` element.

This example sets the outline to a solid blue line with 2 pixels set for the thickness. The focus indicator should be styled in a way that makes it obvious which element currently has focus. In order to be accessible, the indicator must have a minimum color contrast of at least 3:1 with the background color it covers. \n \n You should also avoid keyboard traps, which occur when a user cannot move focus away from a certain element in components like modals and popups."
