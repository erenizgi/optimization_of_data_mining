For example, you can place multiple cursors by using `Ctrl + Alt + down` and `Ctrl + Alt + up` (Windows/Linux), or `Option + Command + down` and `Option + Command + up` (Mac), to extend the cursor to consecutive lines. You can also press and hold `Alt` (Windows/Linux) or `Option` (Mac) and click to add cursors on separate lines wherever you need them. Once the cursors are placed, anything you type or delete will apply to all those locations simultaneously — which can save a lot of time when working with repetitive code.\n+\n Finally, if you forget any of these shortcuts, you always have `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac), which opens the command palette for you to select whatever you may need.\n \n With this knowledge, and maybe a little practice, you are well on your way to becoming a VS Code power user."
