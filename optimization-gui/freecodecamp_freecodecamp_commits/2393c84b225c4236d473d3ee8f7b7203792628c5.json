This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.\n+\n+Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web.\n+\n+Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:\n+\n+1. have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup\n+2. ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content\n+3. create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly\n+\n+Having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work."

You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the `style` attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within `style` tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of your code.\n+\n+The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.\n+\n+In this project, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your application can change it from simple text to something more.\n+\n+<div role=\"alert\" class=\"fade alert alert-info show flash-message-enter-active\">\n+    <p>\n+        Note: Some browser extensions may interfere with elements on the page.
