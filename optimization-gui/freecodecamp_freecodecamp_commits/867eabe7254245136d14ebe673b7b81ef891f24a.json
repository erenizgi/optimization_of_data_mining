These breakpoints are crucial in responsive web design, allowing developers to create websites that look and function well across various devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.\n \n In CSS, media breakpoints are implemented using media queries. These queries allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, most commonly the viewport width. For example, you might set a breakpoint at 768 pixels to differentiate between mobile and tablet layouts.\n \n Here's a simple example of how a media query with a breakpoint might look in CSS:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<div>\n+  <h1>Responsive Design</h1>\n+  <p>This is a simple example of responsive design using media queries.</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n /* Styles for screens wider than 768px */\n @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n@@ -22,6 +32,8 @@ Here's a simple example of how a media query with a breakpoint might look in CSS\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n When the screen width is 768 pixels or larger, the font size increases to `1.125rem` which is 18 pixels. This demonstrates how breakpoints can be used to adjust the design for different screen sizes.\n \n When it comes to choosing breakpoints, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The appropriate breakpoints for your website will depend on your specific design and content. However, there are some common breakpoints that many designers use as starting points in modern web design."
