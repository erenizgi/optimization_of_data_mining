It is designed to create a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array.\n \n This method does not modify the original array but instead returns a new array containing the results of the function applied to each element.\n \n Here is an example of using the `map` method on an array of numbers:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);\n console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n To create a new array where each number is doubled, we are using the `map` method. The `map` method accepts a callback function where the function is called on every single element in the array.\n \n In this case, each number in the array will be multiplied by `2`. The result will be a new array of the numbers `2,4,6,8,10`.\n@@ -28,15 +32,21 @@ The callback function can accept up to three arguments.\n \n The first argument is the current element being processed.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].map((element) => {\n   console.log(\"Element:\", element);\n   return element * 2;\n });\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The second argument is the index of the current element being processed.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].map((element, index) => {\n   console.log(\"Element:\", element);\n@@ -45,8 +55,12 @@ const numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].map((element, index) => {\n });\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The third argument is the array where `map` is being called on.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].map((element, index, array) => {\n   console.log(\"Element:\", element);\n@@ -56,6 +70,8 @@ const numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].map((element, index, array) => {\n });\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Understanding and effectively using the `map` method can significantly improve your ability to work with arrays in JavaScript.
