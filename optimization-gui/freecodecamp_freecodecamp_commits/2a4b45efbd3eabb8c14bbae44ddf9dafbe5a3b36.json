You should have a function named `create_character`.\n+1. The function should accept, in order, a character name followed by three stats: strength, intelligence, and charisma.\n+1. The character name should be validated:\n+   - If the character name is not a string, the function should return `The character name should be a string`.\n+   - If the character name is longer than 10 characters, the function should return `The character name is too long`.\n+   - If the character name contains spaces, the function should return `The character name should not contain spaces`.\n+1. The stats should also be validated:\n+   - If one or more stats are not integers, the function should return `All stats should be integers`.\n+   - If one or more stats are less than 1, the function should return `All stats should be no less than 1`.\n+   - If one or more stats are more than 4, the function should return `All stats should be no more than 4`.\n+   - If the sum of all stats is different than 7, the function should return `The character should start with 7 points`.\n+1. If all values pass the verification, the function should return a string with four lines:\n+   - the first line should contain the character name\n+   - lines 2-4 should start with the stat abbreviation, `STR`, `INT` or `CHA` (in this order), then a space, and then a number of full dots (`●`) equal to the value of the stat, and a number of empty dots (`○`) to reach 10. Example: if the value of strength is 3 there must be 3 full dots followed by 7 empty dots. The dots are given in the editor.\n+\n+Here's the string `create_character(\"ren\", 4, 2, 1)` should return:\n+\n+   ```md\n+   ren\n+   STR ●●●●○○○○○○\n+   INT ●●○○○○○○○○\n+   CHA ●○○○○○○○○○\n+   ```\n+\n+NOTE: while `str` and `int` are common abbreviations for the stats, remember that those are reserved keywords in Python and should not be used as variable names.\n+\n+# --hints--\n+\n+You
