It has been part of the language since its inception and for many years it remained the primary method for creating variables. However as JavaScript evolved and developers gained more experience with the language, certain drawbacks of using `var` became apparent leading to the introduction of `let` and `const` in 2015.\n \n When you declare a variable with `var`, it becomes function-scoped or globally-scoped. This means that if you declare a variable inside a function using `var` it's only accessible within that function. However if you declare it outside any function, it becomes a global variable accessible throughout your entire script. This behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected results and make your code harder to reason about.\n@@ -30,7 +23,7 @@ var num = 10;\n The most significant issue with `var` is its lack of block scoping. Variables declared with `var` inside a block like an `if` statement or a `for` loop are still accessible outside that block. \n \n ```js\n-if (true){\n+if (true) {\n   var num = 5;\n }\n console.log(num); // 5"

In simple terms hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase before the code is executed.\n \n To understand hoisting, it's important to know that JavaScript runs in two phases: the compilation phase and the execution phase. During the compilation phase, the JavaScript engine goes through your code and sets up memory space for variables and functions. This is where hoisting comes into play."
