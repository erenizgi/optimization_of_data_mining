It’s one of the simplest ways to get input from a user through a small pop-up dialog box.\n \n@@ -15,37 +15,43 @@ So, what exactly does the `prompt()` method do? It opens a dialog box that asks\n \n The `prompt()` method takes two arguments: The first one is the message which will appear inside the dialog box, typically prompting the user to enter information. And the second one is a default value which is optional and will fill the input field initially.\n \n-Here's an example of how it works:\n+```js\n+prompt(message, default);\n+```\n+\n+Here's an example of how it works.\n+\n+**NOTE**: This example includes code you have not learned yet. Don't worry about trying to understand everything in the code. This is just to illustrate how the `prompt()` method works and ensure that the prompt doesn't appear immediately when the page loads which can be seen as intrusive.

If the user presses \"Cancel,\" the `userName` variable will be set to `null`. `null` signifies that the user did not provide any input. The output paragraph will then display a greeting message using the provided name or `Guest` if the user canceled.\n \n Keep in mind that the `prompt()` method will halt the execution of the script until the user interacts with the dialog box.\n \n This means the rest of your JavaScript code won’t run until the user either provides input and clicks \"OK\", or cancels the prompt.\n \n One other point to consider is that while `prompt()` is useful for quick testing or small applications, it's generally avoided in modern, complex web applications due to its disruptive nature and inconsistent behavior across different browsers.\n \n-Here's an example:\n-\n-```js\n-let age = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n-if (age !== null) {\n-  console.log(\"You are \" + age + \" years old.\");\n-} else {\n-  console.log(\"User canceled the prompt.\");\n-}\n-```\n-\n-In this example, if the user provides input, it will be displayed in the console. If they cancel, the console will log that the user canceled the prompt.\n-\n By understanding the `prompt()` method, you gain a simple way to interact with users and retrieve information directly through the browser, even though it may not be widely used in modern web applications.\n \n # --questions--"
