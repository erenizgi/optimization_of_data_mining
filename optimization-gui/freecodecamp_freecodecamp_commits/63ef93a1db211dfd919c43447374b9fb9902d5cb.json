A great use case is for icons. If you want to create custom bullet points, or add icons to your links to represent social media platforms, using SVGs is the best approach. One of the most popular icon libraries, Font Awesome, uses SVG images for their icons. SVGs are also great for webpage logos, because they scale perfectly. They allow you to adapt your layout to any responsive design you need. Next time you have an SVG locally, try opening it with a text editor and playing with the code.\n \n # --questions--"
