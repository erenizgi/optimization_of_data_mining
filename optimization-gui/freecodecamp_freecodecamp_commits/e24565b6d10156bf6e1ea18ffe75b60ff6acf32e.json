You learned that classes are like blueprints that you can use to create objects.\n \n These blueprints need a general way to refer to the specific object that is being created, accessed, or modified within the code. That's exactly what the `this` keyword is used for. It refers to the context where the code is supposed to run. If you use it within a method, the value of `this` will be a reference to the object associated to that method. This way, you can access the properties and methods of the object within the class and reuse the method on different objects."

Unlike a traditional loop, recursion allows you to handle something with an unknown depth, such as deeply nested objects/arrays, or a file tree. But you can also use it for more basic tasks, such as counting down from a given number."
