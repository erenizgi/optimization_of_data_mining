Don't worry about trying to understand all of the code. The goal of the examples is to show you previews for these design concepts so you better understand how things work.\n \n First, you may need to familiarize yourself with contrast. Contrast is the difference between two colors - or how easy it is to tell them apart.\n \n Colors with a higher contrast will be more visually distinct, whereas colors with a lower contrast will be more visually similar. For example, black and white have a very high contrast ratio. Whereas light blue and light purple have less of a contrast.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<style>\n+  .example {\n+    padding: 20px;\n+    margin-bottom: 20px;\n+    font-size: 18px;\n+    font-family: sans-serif;\n+  }\n+\n+  .high-contrast {\n+    background-color: black;\n+    color: white;\n+  }\n+\n+  .low-contrast {\n+    background-color: #add8e6; \n+    color: #dda0dd; \n+  }\n+\n+  .label {\n+    font-weight: bold;\n+    margin-bottom: 5px;\n+  }\n+</style>\n+\n+<div class=\"example high-contrast\">\n+  <div class=\"label\">High Contrast</div>\n+  This text has high contrast (black background and white text).\n+</div>\n+\n+<div class=\"example low-contrast\">\n+  <div class=\"label\">Low Contrast</div>\n+  This text has low contrast (light blue background and light purple text).\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n Of course, in these examples the distinction might be made clearer because of the layout.

You can't base it solely on how the text looks to you, as every user will have a different experience. Thankfully, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG, provide a standard for this. \n \n Text with a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 is considered the AA standard, which is the bare minimum you should follow to be accessible to most users. Text with a contrast ratio of 7:1 is considered the AAA standard, and ensures the best level of accessibility.\n \n-There are a number of websites that can check the contrast ratio between two colors, but most browsers will allow you to do this directly in the developer tools on your website.\n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<style>\n+  .contrast-example {\n+    padding: 15px;\n+    margin-bottom: 20px;\n+    font-size: 18px;\n+    font-family: sans-serif;\n+  }\n+\n+  .aa-contrast {\n+    background-color: #ffffff; \n+    color: #4b4b4b; \n+  }\n+\n+  .aaa-contrast {\n+    background-color: #ffffff; \n+    color: #1a1a1a; \n+  }\n+\n+  .label {\n+    font-weight: bold;\n+    margin-bottom: 8px;\n+    display: block;\n+  }\n+</style>\n+\n+<div class=\"contrast-example aa-contrast\">\n+  <span class=\"label\">AA Standard (Contrast Ratio ~4.5:1)</span>\n+  This text meets the minimum accessibility standard for contrast.\n+</div>\n+\n+<div class=\"contrast-example aaa-contrast\">\n+  <span class=\"label\">AAA Standard (Contrast Ratio ~7:1)</span>\n+  This text meets the highest accessibility standard for contrast.\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+:::\n \n-Let's open the developer tools and inspect the text elements of the example site.\n+There are a number of websites that can check the contrast ratio between two colors, but most browsers will allow you to do this directly in the developer tools on your website.\n \n-The black text on a white background has a contrast ratio of 21:1, which more than meets the AAA standard. The purple text on a blue background, however, has a contrast ratio of 1.48:1, which does not even meet the AA standard.\n+Let's take a look at a few more examples of contrast ratio to better understand the concept. \n+\n+Here is an example of black text on a white background which has a contrast ratio of 21:1.\n+\n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<style>\n+  .contrast-21 {\n+    background-color: white;\n+    color: black;\n+    padding: 15px;\n+    font-family: sans-serif;\n+    font-size: 18px;\n+    margin-bottom: 20px;\n+  }\n+\n+  .label {\n+    font-weight: bold;\n+    margin-bottom: 8px;\n+    display: block;\n+  }\n+</style>\n+\n+<div class=\"contrast-21\">\n+  <span class=\"label\">Contrast Ratio 21:1</span>\n+  This is black text on a white background, which has the highest contrast ratio of 21:1.\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n+This example more than meets the AAA standard.

Well, there are three aspects that impact the contrast ratio.\n \n The first is the hue, which represents the general color type, like red, blue, orange. Let's shift to a hue that is further away from blue. In this case, let's use red.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<style>\n+  .contrast-21 {\n+    background-color: white;\n+    color: black;\n+    padding: 15px;\n+    font-family: sans-serif;\n+    font-size: 18px;\n+    margin-bottom: 20px;\n+  }\n+\n+  .label {\n+    font-weight: bold;\n+    margin-bottom: 8px;\n+    display: block;\n+  }\n+\n+  .red-on-blue {\n+    background-color: #0000cc; \n+    color: #ff0000; \n+    padding: 15px;\n+    font-family: sans-serif;\n+    font-size: 18px;\n+    margin-bottom: 20px;\n+  }\n+</style>\n+\n+<div class=\"contrast-21\">\n+  <span class=\"label\">Contrast Ratio 21:1</span>\n+  This example more than meets the AAA standard with black text on white background.\n+</div>\n+\n+<div class=\"red-on-blue\">\n+  <span class=\"label\">Red on Blue (Higher Contrast Hue Shift)</span>\n+  This doesn't meet accessibility standards.\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n Unfortunately, this change only brought the contrast ratio to 1.49:1,  which means you need to change the saturation, or the \"amount\" of color present.
