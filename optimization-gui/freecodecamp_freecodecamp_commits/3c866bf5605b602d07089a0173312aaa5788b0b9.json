Backwards compatibility refers to when current software is compatible with earlier versions. Forwards compatibility is when software and systems will work with future versions of itself.\n \n-The next type of testing is for hardware. Hardware compatibility testing focuses on the software's ability to work properly in different hardware configurations. This includes components like processors, memory, different storage types, and graphics cards.\n+The next type of testing is for hardware. Hardware compatibility testing focuses on the software's ability to work properly in different hardware configurations. This includes different types of processors, memory, storage, and graphics cards.\n \n Another type of compatibility testing is for operating systems. You don't want to design software that works smoothly on Mac devices but has bugs on Windows or vice versa. You also need to consider Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora.\n "
