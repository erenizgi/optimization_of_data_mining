It's a special value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined numerical result. `NaN` is a property of the global object, and it's also considered a type of number in JavaScript, which might seem counterintuitive at first.\n \n `NaN` is typically the result of operations that should return a number but can't produce a meaningful numerical value. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let result = 0 / 0;\n-console.log(result); // Output: NaN\n+console.log(result); // NaN\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this case, dividing zero by zero is mathematically undefined, so JavaScript returns `NaN`. One peculiar property of `NaN` is that it's not equal to anything, including itself:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n-console.log(NaN === NaN); // Output: false\n+console.log(NaN === NaN); // false\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This unique behavior makes it challenging to check if a value is `NaN` using standard comparison operators. To address this, JavaScript provides the `isNaN()` function. The `isNaN()` function property is used to determine whether a value is `NaN` or not. However, it's important to understand how `isNaN()` works, as it can sometimes produce unexpected results. Here's how `isNaN()` behaves:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(isNaN(NaN));       // true\n console.log(isNaN(undefined)); // true\n@@ -41,10 +51,14 @@ console.log(isNaN(\" \"));       // false: string with a space is converted to 0\n console.log(isNaN(\"blabla\"));  // true: \"blabla\" is not a number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n As you can see, `isNaN()` first attempts to convert the parameter to a number. If it can't be converted, it returns `true`. This behavior can lead to some surprising results, especially when dealing with strings that can be coerced into numbers.\n \n Due to these potential inconsistencies, ES6 (the sixth edition of JavaScript, released in 2015) introduced `Number.isNaN()`. This method does not attempt to convert the parameter to a number before testing. It only returns `true` if the value is exactly `NaN`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN));        // true\n console.log(Number.isNaN(Number.NaN)); // true\n@@ -56,22 +70,26 @@ console.log(Number.isNaN({}));         // false\n console.log(Number.isNaN(\"blabla\"));   // false\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `Number.isNaN()` provides a more reliable way to check for `NaN` values, especially in cases where type coercion might lead to unexpected results with the global `isNaN()` function. In practice, when dealing with numerical operations or user inputs that should be numbers, it's often necessary to check for `NaN` to handle errors or unexpected inputs gracefully. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n-function divide(a, b) {\n-  let result = a / b;\n-  if (Number.isNaN(result)) {\n-    return \"Error: Division resulted in NaN\";\n-  }\n-  return result;\n+let a = 0;\n+let b = 0;\n+let result = a / b;\n+\n+if (Number.isNaN(result)) {\n+  result = \"Error: Division resulted in NaN\";\n }\n \n-console.log(divide(10, 2));  // 5\n-console.log(divide(10, 0));  // Infinity\n-console.log(divide(0, 0));   // \"Error: Division resulted in NaN\"\n+console.log(result); // \"Error: Division resulted in NaN\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we're using `Number.isNaN()` to catch cases where the division operation results in `NaN`, allowing us to handle this scenario appropriately. Understanding `NaN` and how to properly check for it is crucial for writing robust JavaScript code, especially when dealing with mathematical operations or parsing user inputs.\n \n # --questions--"
