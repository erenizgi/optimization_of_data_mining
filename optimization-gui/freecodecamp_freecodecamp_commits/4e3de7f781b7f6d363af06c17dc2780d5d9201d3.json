If the element cannot be found, then it will return `-1`. Here is the basic syntax:\n \n@@ -15,32 +15,44 @@ array.indexOf(element, fromIndex)\n \n `element` represents the value you want to search for within the array, and the `fromIndex` parameter is the position from which the search should start. The `fromIndex` parameter is optional. If `fromIndex` is not provided, the search starts from the beginning of the array. Let's look at an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"banana\"];\n let index = fruits.indexOf(\"banana\");\n console.log(index); // 1\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we have an array `fruits` containing various fruit names. We use the `indexOf()` method to find the index of the string `banana` within the `fruits` array. Since `banana` is present at index `1`, the method returns `1`, which is stored in the `index` variable and logged to the console.\n \n If the element you're searching for is not found in the array, `indexOf()` returns `-1`. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"];\n let index = fruits.indexOf(\"grape\");\n console.log(index); // -1\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, we search for the string `grape` in the fruits array using `indexOf()`. Since `grape` is not present in the array, the method returns `-1`, which is stored in the `index` variable and logged to the console.\n \n If you want to start looking for an item after a specific index number, then you can pass a second argument like in this example: \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"green\"];\n let index = colors.indexOf(\"green\", 3);\n console.log(index); // 4\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, the search does not start from the start of an array, rather it starts from the index number `3` which is `yellow` and gets the output of `4`.\n \n # --questions--"
