A code editor is any application that allows you to edit code files. An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a full application that allows you to compile, run, and debug your code while you edit it.\n+\n+Perhaps some examples might be helpful.\n+\n+First, let's consider a few popular IDEs. Visual Studio is an integrated development environment by Microsoft that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building, debugging, and deploying applications across various platforms.\n+\n+Another IDE is XCode. Xcode is an integrated development environment by Apple designed for creating, coding, and debugging applications for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.\n+\n+And another IDE would be Android Studio. Android Studio is an integrated development environment by Google specifically designed for building, debugging, and testing Android applications.\n+\n+Those are just a few examples of IDEs. Now, let's take a look at a few popular code editors.\n+\n+Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor by Microsoft that supports a wide range of programming languages and provides features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and version control through extensions.\n+\n+Another popular editor would be Sublime Text. Sublime Text is a fast, versatile text editor known for its sleek interface, powerful features, and support for a wide range of programming languages through customizable syntax highlighting and plugins.\n+\n+And another one is Notepad++. This is a free, open-source, text and source code editor for Windows that offers syntax highlighting, code folding, and a range of plugins to enhance productivity and customization.\n+\n+You may have noticed how the code editors focus primarily on the text contents of the file, where the IDEs expose various tools to manage your code.\n+\n+These examples are all local programs you can run on your computer, but there are also cloud-based editors that you can use.\n+\n+A cloud-based editor is an online tool that allows users to write, edit, and manage code or text directly through a web browser without needing to install software locally.\n+\n+Let's take a look at a few cloud-based editors.\n+\n+Replit is an online platform that provides a collaborative environment for coding, allowing users to write, run, and share code in various programming languages directly from a web browser.\n+\n+Another popular cloud-based editor is GitHub Codespaces. This is a cloud-based development environment that provides instant access to a fully-configured code editor and development tools directly from GitHub, enabling seamless coding and collaboration.\n+\n+And another one is Gitpod. Gitpod is a cloud-based development environment that integrates with GitHub and GitLab, offering instant, customizable workspaces for coding, building, and debugging directly from your browser.\n+\n+And there are many more options. Some options, such as Visual Studio Code, are highly extensible and can work with multiple different project types and languages. Other options might be specifically tailored to a small subset of languages or project types.\n+\n+The application you use might be different for specific projects. You should explore the options to see what will work best for your needs.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

The workspace is whichever directory you opened in VS Code.\n+\n+To begin, you will need to use a command line interface to create a new directory for your new project. A directory is another name for the folder.\n+\n+Command-line interfaces, or CLI for short, allow you to interact with your operating system through text-based commands. You will learn more about these tools in future lecture videos.\n+\n+If you are on Windows, you can use the Command Prompt or PowerShell. If you are on a Mac, you can open up your Terminal app.\n+\n+Once the command line is open, navigate to the home directory by typing in the `cd ~` command and hitting `enter` on your keyboard. Then type in the `mkdir my-project` command and hit `enter`. `mkdir`, or \"make directory\" is the command used to create a new directory. You should then open your new directory with VS Code. \n+\n+There are also some other graphical ways to creata a new directory.\n+\n+Depending on your operating system, you might have a context menu (or right-click option) to open VS Code directly from your file explorer. You could also choose to double-click on the VS Code application. If you feel comfortable with the command line you can run the command `code /path/to/folder`.\n+\n+Once it's open, you should see a new blank workspace.\n+\n+To create a new file, click on the `File` menu at the top-left corner and select `New File...`. Then name your file `index.html` and click on `Save`.\n+\n+Now you should see your new file in the explorer tab. Try adding some HTML to your `index.html` file.\n+\n+Now you might be tempted to open the HTML file in your browser directly. While that can work, it can also lead to all sorts of unexpected bugs, such as CSS not loading properly.\n+\n+Instead, you should put your HTML file behind a proper web server. That can sound like an intimidating task if you are new to coding, but there's actually a way to do this right from VS Code.\n+\n+You'll need to grab the _Live Server_ extension first, which is available for free in the marketplace.\n+\n+Click on the extensions tab in the left hand corner and type in `Live Server` in the search bar.\n+\n+Once you have this installed, you should see a `Go live` button in your status bar. Make sure you have your HTML file open, and then click it.\n+\n+Your new page should open automatically in a new tab in the browser. If it doesn't then you can go directly to `http://localhost:5500/`\n+\n+Congratulations! You've now set up your very own project in VS Code, and can view your changes with live server.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n@@ -22,27 +60,27 @@ The entire hard drive.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-The lecture mentions how VSCode defines a workspace in relation to directories.\n+The lecture mentions how VS Code defines a workspace in relation to directories.\n \n ---\n \n-The directory you opened VSCode from.\n+The directory you opened VS Code from.\n \n ---\n \n-All open files in VSCode.\n+All open files in VS Code.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-The lecture mentions how VSCode defines a workspace in relation to directories.\n+The lecture mentions how VS Code defines a workspace in relation to directories.\n \n ---\n \n-The VSCode application folder.\n+The VS Code application folder.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-The lecture mentions how VSCode defines a workspace in relation to directories.\n+The lecture mentions how VS Code defines a workspace in relation to directories.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n@@ -86,7 +124,7 @@ The lecture mentions a specific issue that can occur when opening HTML files dir\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What VSCode extension is recommended for easily setting up a local web server?\n+What VS Code extension is recommended for easily setting up a local web server?\n \n ## --answers--\n "

In combination with VS Code's native bracket pair colorization, this can dramatically help identify what scope your code is in.\n+\n+Or maybe you're looking for something a bit more practical? Consider an AI assistant, like _Github Copilot_ or _Tabnine_, to offer you inline suggestions as you are writing your code.\n+\n+An icon pack, such as _VS Code Great Icons_, can help make your file tree cleaner and easier to parse at a glance. And an extension like _Colorize_ can help you understand the values in your CSS properties.\n+\n+You'll also want language-specific extensions for your projects.
