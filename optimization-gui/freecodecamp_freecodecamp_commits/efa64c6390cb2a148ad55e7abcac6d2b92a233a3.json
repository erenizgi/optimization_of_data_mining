The `ls` command also takes flags to show hidden files (the `-a` flag), file permissions (the `-l` flag), and other features. You will learn more about command flags in the next lesson. You can also use `less` or `cat` to view the contents of a file. \n \n-What if the directory does not contain the file or folder you need? There are commands called `mkdir` and touch that allow you to create them. `mkdir` creates a new directory, or folder, and `touch` creates a new file.

This might seem silly to run in the terminal, just to get text back in the terminal, but you can actually chain `echo` to a control symbol. The `>` symbol allows you to specify a filename to create or overwrite with the new string, like `echo \"Naomi was here.\" > readme.md`, and the `>>` symbol will append to the file.\n \n-There are many more Bash commands available to you, such as `head`, `tail`, `chown`, and `chmod`.
