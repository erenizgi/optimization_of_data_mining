This has an added benefit of automatically signing you in, rather than having to provide a token every time. There will be a separate lecture diving deeper into SSH and how it works but you can also read through the GitHub documentation on how to setup SSH.\n+For cloning a public repository, you won't actually need to authenticate.

A good design can make the shopping cart experience more enjoyable and increase sales. A poor design can lead to abandoned carts and lost sales.\n \n-In this lecture, we will discuss some best practices for designing shopping carts. The first design consideration is making sure the shopping cart is visible to users at all times. Most shopping cart designs will have the cart displayed in the upper right hand corner of the page. Users should see the number of items in their cart displayed next to the cart icon, and be able to click on the cart to see more details about the items they are purchasing.\n+In this lesson, we will discuss some best practices for designing shopping carts.

It involves formatting text and selecting appropriate fonts. In this lesson, you will learn best practices for using typography in a way that enhances readability, hierarchy, and accessibility. \n \n Let's start with readability. You should choose clear and simple fonts to make your designs easy to understand. This is particularly important for the main text of your website. Users are more likely to engage with your content if the font is easy to read. Some frequently used fonts for web development are Roboto, Open Sans, Poppins, Lato, and Barlow. But there are many to choose from and you will definitely find one that fits your needs.\n "
