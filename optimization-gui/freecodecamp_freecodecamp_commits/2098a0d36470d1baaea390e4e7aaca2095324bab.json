This approach transforms problems that would normally take exponential time into ones that can be solved in polynomial time.\n+\n+## Core Principles of Dynamic Programming\n+\n+Dynamic programming works when two key conditions are present in a problem.\n+\n+- **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same smaller problems appear multiple times when solving the larger problem. Instead of recalculating these subproblems repeatedly, we store their solutions.\n+    \n+- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems. This means we can build up the best solution by combining the best solutions to smaller parts.\n+    \n+\n+Let's examine these concepts using the classic \"climbing stairs\" problem.\n+\n+## The Problem with Naive Recursion\n+\n+Consider the climbing stairs problem: you're climbing a staircase with `n` steps and can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many distinct ways can you reach the top?\n+\n+```python\n+def climb_stairs_recursive(n):\n+    \"\"\"Recursive approach\"\"\"\n+    if n <= 2:\n+        return n  # Base cases: 1 way for 1 step, 2 ways for 2 steps\n+    # To reach step n, we can come from step (n-1) or step (n-2)\n+    return climb_stairs_recursive(n-1) + climb_stairs_recursive(n-2)\n+```\n+\n+This implementation has exponential time complexity because of massive redundant calculations. When calculating `climb_stairs(5)`, here's what happens:\n+\n+- `climb_stairs(5)` calls `climb_stairs(4)` and `climb_stairs(3)`\n+    \n+- `climb_stairs(4)` calls `climb_stairs(3)` and `climb_stairs(2)`\n+    \n+- Now `climb_stairs(3)` is calculated **twice**\n+    \n+- `climb_stairs(3)` calls `climb_stairs(2)` and `climb_stairs(1)`\n+    \n+- `climb_stairs(2)` gets calculated **3 times total**\n+    \n+\n+For just `n=5`, we make 9 function calls when we only need 5 unique calculations. As `n` grows, this redundancy explodes exponentially - `climb_stairs(30)` would require over 1 billion function calls! The time complexity becomes `O(2^n)`, making it inefficient and impractical for larger values of `n`.\n+\n+## Dynamic Programming Solutions\n+\n+Dynamic programming eliminates this redundant computation through two main approaches:\n+\n+### Memoization (Top-Down Approach)\n+\n+Memoization stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again:\n+\n+```python\n+def climb_stairs_memo(n, memo={}):\n+    \"\"\"Dynamic programming with memoization\"\"\"\n+    # Check if we've already calculated this value\n+    if n in memo:\n+        return memo[n]  # Return cached result - O(1) lookup!\n+    \n+    # Base cases\n+    if n <= 2:\n+        return n\n+    \n+    # Calculate once and store in memo for future use\n+    memo[n] = climb_stairs_memo(n-1, memo) + climb_stairs_memo(n-2, memo)\n+    return memo[n]\n+```\n+\n+Memoization is so much more efficient because each unique value from `1` to `n` is calculated exactly once. When we need `climb_stairs(3)` again, instead of recalculating it (which would trigger more recursive calls), we simply look it up in our memo dictionary in `O(1)` time.\n+\n+Let's trace through the execution of `climb_stairs(5)` with the top-down approach to see how memoization eliminates redundant work:\n+\n+```md\n+Call: climb_stairs_memo(5)\n+  memo = {} (empty)\n+  \n+  Call: climb_stairs_memo(4) \n+    memo = {} (empty)\n+    \n+    Call: climb_stairs_memo(3)\n+      memo = {} (empty)\n+      \n+      Call: climb_stairs_memo(2) → returns 2 (base case)\n+      Call: climb_stairs_memo(1) → returns 1 (base case)\n+      \n+      Result: 2 + 1 = 3\n+      memo = {3: 3} (stored!)\n+    \n+    Call: climb_stairs_memo(2) → returns 2 (base case)\n+    \n+    Result: 3 + 2 = 5\n+    memo = {3: 3, 4: 5} (stored!)\n+  \n+  Call: climb_stairs_memo(3) → returns 3 (FROM MEMO - no recursion!)\n+  \n+  Result: 5 + 3 = 8\n+  memo = {3: 3, 4: 5, 5: 8}\n+```\n+\n+**Efficiency comparison**\n+\n+- **Naive recursive**: Makes 9 function calls with repeated calculations\n+    \n+- **Memoization**: Makes only 5 unique calculations, then reuses stored results\n+    \n+- **Time complexity**: Reduced from `O(2^n)` to `O(n)` since we make only `n` unique calculations\n+    \n+- **Space complexity**: `O(n)` for the memo storage and call stack\n+    \n+- **Real impact**: `climb_stairs(30)` drops from 1+ billion calls to just 30 calls!\n+    \n+\n+### Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)\n+\n+Tabulation builds the solution from the ground up, filling a table with solutions to subproblems:\n+\n+```python\n+def climb_stairs_tabulation(n):\n+    \"\"\"Dynamic programming with tabulation\"\"\"\n+    if n <= 2:\n+        return n\n+    \n+    # Create array to store results for all steps from 0 to n\n+    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n+    dp[1] = 1  # 1 way to reach step 1\n+    dp[2] = 2  # 2 ways to reach step 2\n+    \n+    # Build up the solution iteratively\n+    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n+        # Ways to reach step i = ways to reach (i-1) + ways to reach (i-2)\n+        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n+    \n+    return dp[n]\n+```\n+\n+Tabulation eliminates recursion entirely by building the solution iteratively from the smallest subproblems up to the target.\n+\n+Let's see the bottom-up approach in action to see how we build the solution systematically.

coin] + 1)\n+    \n+    # Return result if possible, -1 if impossible\n+    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n+\n+# Example usage:\n+# coins = [1, 3, 4], amount = 6\n+# dp[6] = min(dp[5]+1, dp[3]+1, dp[2]+1) = min(3+1, 1+1, 2+1) = 2\n+# Result: 2 coins (3 + 3)\n+```\n+\n+And here's how the dynamic programming coin change algorithm works step by step for `coins = [1, 3, 4]`, `amount = 6`:\n+\n+```md\n+Initial state:\n+dp = [0, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞]\n+     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] ← amounts\n+\n+Building up the solution:\n+\n+For amount = 1:\n+  Try coin 1: dp[1] = min(∞, dp[0] + 1) = min(∞, 0 + 1) = 1\n+  dp = [0, 1, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞]\n+\n+For amount = 2:\n+  Try coin 1: dp[2] = min(∞, dp[1] + 1) = min(∞, 1 + 1) = 2\n+  dp = [0, 1, 2, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞]\n+\n+For amount = 3:\n+  Try coin 1: dp[3] = min(∞, dp[2] + 1) = min(∞, 2 + 1) = 3\n+  Try coin 3: dp[3] = min(3, dp[0] + 1) = min(3, 0 + 1) = 1\n+  dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, ∞, ∞, ∞]\n+\n+For amount = 4:\n+  Try coin 1: dp[4] = min(∞, dp[3] + 1) = min(∞, 1 + 1) = 2\n+  Try coin 3: dp[4] = min(2, dp[1] + 1) = min(2, 1 + 1) = 2\n+  Try coin 4: dp[4] = min(2, dp[0] + 1) = min(2, 0 + 1) = 1\n+  dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, ∞, ∞]\n+\n+For amount = 5:\n+  Try coin 1: dp[5] = min(∞, dp[4] + 1) = min(∞, 1 + 1) = 2\n+  Try coin 3: dp[5] = min(2, dp[2] + 1) = min(2, 2 + 1) = 2\n+  Try coin 4: dp[5] = min(2, dp[1] + 1) = min(2, 1 + 1) = 2\n+  dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, ∞]\n+\n+For amount = 6:\n+  Try coin 1: dp[6] = min(∞, dp[5] + 1) = min(∞, 2 + 1) = 3\n+  Try coin 3: dp[6] = min(3, dp[3] + 1) = min(3, 1 + 1) = 2\n+  Try coin 4: dp[6] = min(2, dp[2] + 1) = min(2, 2 + 1) = 2\n+  dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n+\n+Final result: dp[6] = 2 (achieved with coins 3 + 3)\n+```\n+\n+This solution demonstrates both key principles of dynamic programming. It has overlapping subproblems because finding the minimum coins for amount 6 requires knowing the solutions for amounts 5, 3, and 2. These same subproblems appear when calculating other amounts. It has optimal substructure because the optimal solution for any amount incorporates optimal solutions for smaller amounts. If we know the minimum coins for amount 3 is 1, then one way to make amount 6 is to use that solution plus one more coin of value 3.\n+\n+Without DP, we'd need to try every possible combination of coins - an exponential number of possibilities. With DP, we build up the solution systematically:\n+\n+- **Time complexity**: `O(amount × number of coins)` instead of exponential.\n+    \n+- **Space complexity**: `O(amount)` for the `dp` array.\n+    \n+- **No redundant work**: Each subproblem (finding minimum coins for each amount) is solved exactly once.\n+    \n+- **Reusable results**: Once we know the minimum coins for amount 3, we use this knowledge for all larger amounts that can benefit from it.\n+    \n+\n+## When to Use Dynamic Programming\n+\n+Dynamic programming is effective when:\n+\n+- The problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems.\n+    \n+- The problem exhibits optimal substructure.\n+    \n+- A naive recursive solution would involve repeated calculations.\n+    \n+- You need to optimize for time complexity at the cost of space complexity.\n+    \n+\n+Common dynamic programming patterns include optimization problems (finding minimum/maximum values), counting problems (number of ways to achieve something), and decision problems that can be broken down into smaller decisions.\n+\n+Dynamic programming transforms complex problems into manageable ones by systematically storing and reusing solutions to subproblems. Understanding this technique opens the door to solving a wide range of computational challenges efficiently.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-Question 1\n+What are the two key conditions that must be present for dynamic programming to be applicable?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1.1\n+Fast execution and low memory usage.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 1\n+Think about what makes a problem suitable for dynamic programming optimization.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 1.2\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-Feedback 1\n+Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 1.3\n+Recursive calls and iterative loops.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 1\n+Think about what makes a problem suitable for dynamic programming optimization.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 1.4\n+Memoization and tabulation.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 1\n+Think about what makes a problem suitable for dynamic programming optimization.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-5\n+2\n \n ## --text--\n \n-Question 2\n+What is the main difference between memoization and tabulation approaches in dynamic programming?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 2.1\n+Memoization uses more memory than tabulation.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 2\n+Consider the direction in which each approach builds the solution.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2.2\n+Tabulation is always faster than memoization.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 2\n+Consider the direction in which each approach builds the solution.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2.3\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-Feedback 2\n+Memoization is top-down while tabulation is bottom-up.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2.4\n+Memoization only works with recursive functions.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 2\n+Consider the direction in which each approach builds the solution.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-5\n+3\n \n ## --text--\n \n-Question 3\n+In the naive recursive climbing stairs implementation, what is the time complexity and why is it inefficient?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 3.1\n+`O(n)` because it calculates each step once.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 3\n+Think about how many times the same stair counts get calculated in the recursive tree.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3.2\n+`O(n²)` because it uses nested loops.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 3\n+Think about how many times the same stair counts get calculated in the recursive tree.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3.3\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-Feedback 3\n+`O(2^n)` because it recalculates the same subproblems multiple times.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3.4\n+`O(log n)` because it divides the problem in half.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Feedback 3\n+Think about how many times the same stair counts get calculated in the recursive tree.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-5\n-\n+3"
