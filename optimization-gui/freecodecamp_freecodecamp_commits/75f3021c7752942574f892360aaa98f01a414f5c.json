Officially defined as \"an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.\"\n+- **Open Source**: Node.js code is publicly available and maintained by a large community of developers.\n+- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n+- **JavaScript Runtime Environment**: Allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser.\n+\n+## Node.js Use Cases\n+\n+- **Common Applications**: Node.js is used across a wide range of industries for:\n+  - Building web servers and APIs that handle HTTP requests.\n+  - Developing web and mobile applications.\n+  - Handling complex data and database interactions.\n+- **Industry Adoption**: If you are using or developing a website or web application that interacts with a database or handles complex data, there is a high chance that you will use Node.js behind the scenes.\n+- **Key Characteristics**: Node.js is efficient, scalable, and has a large community of developers and maintainers around the world.\n+\n+## Browser vs. Node Runtime Environment\n+\n+- **Browser Environment**: Primarily designed for front-end web development, runs client-side JavaScript.\n+- **Node Runtime Environment**: Primarily designed for back-end web development, runs server-side JavaScript.\n+- **API Differences**: The environment determines the APIs available:\n+  - **Browser**: Access to the DOM API, but restrictions for accessing the local file system.\n+  - **Node**: Access to almost all system resources, including the file system, but not the DOM.\n+\n+## Global Objects\n+\n+- **Browser Global Object (`window`)**: Provides access to browser-related functionalities:\n+  - Methods for manipulating the DOM.\n+  - Managing cookies.\n+  - Handling browser events.\n+\n+- **Node.js Global Object (`global`)**: Provides access to Node.js specific functionalities:\n+  - Built-in modules for working with local files.\n+  - Networking capabilities.\n+  - Interacting with the operating system.\n+\n+## Version Control\n+\n+- **Browser Version**: You have no control over the version of the browser environment that your users will use to visit your website.\n+- **Node.js Version**: You can choose the version of Node.js that you want to use in your server.\n+\n+## Importance of Node.js\n+\n+- **Full-Stack Development**: Node.js has transformed web development by enabling developers to use JavaScript to build both the frontend and the backend of full-stack applications.\n+- **Efficiency**: The development process is more efficient because developers don't need to learn a new programming language just for developing the backend.\n+- **Impact**: Node.js is a powerful, scalable, and versatile tool that has become very important for developers worldwide.\n+\n+## Advantages of Node.js\n+\n+- **Single Language for Full-Stack**: You can implement both the front-end and the back-end of a web application using JavaScript.\n+  - Reduces the initial learning curve.\n+  - No need to switch between programming languages.\n+  - Increases efficiency and productivity.\n+\n+- **Non-Blocking, Event-Driven Architecture**: Great for developing real-time applications where responsiveness and efficiency are essential for creating a good user experience.\n+\n+- **Single Thread and Event Loop**: Can effectively handle a large number of simultaneous requests and Input-Output operations.\n+  - Perfect for applications that require handling multiple requests simultaneously.\n+\n+- **Large Community**: Thousands of developers around the world constantly maintain Node.js and add new features.\n+  - Many learning resources available.\n+  - Easy to find answers to questions.\n+\n+- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: A powerful tool that allows you to install and manage packages and modules for your projects.\n+  - Packages available for many purposes: handling HTTP requests, working with databases, formatting dates and times, testing code, and more.\n+  - Reuse code written, tested, and shared by other developers.\n+  - Makes workflow faster and more efficient.\n+\n+- **Cost-Effective**: Node.js is free and open source.\n+  - Packages, libraries, and associated tools are also primarily free.\n+  - Important factor when optimizing budget.\n+\n+## Disadvantages of Node.js\n+\n+- **Single-Threaded Limitation**: Only runs one thread at a time, meaning it can only handle one operation at a time.\n+  - While architecture allows efficient handling of concurrent (simultaneous) requests, CPU-intensive tasks may block the main thread and result in performance issues.\n+  - Examples of CPU-intensive tasks: complex mathematical operations, image and video processing, cryptography.\n+  - Ways to overcome this exist, but usually increase application complexity.\n+\n+- **Asynchronous Programming**: Node.js relies on asynchronous programming.\n+  - A task that may take a long time to run is started, but instead of waiting until it's completed, the main program continues running while the asynchronous task runs in parallel.\n+  - When the task is completed, the program handles the result.\n+  - Often involves \"callbacks,\" which are functions that define what happens when asynchronous operations are completed.\n+  - Can potentially make code more difficult to read, understand, and debug.\n+\n+- **Package Quality Concerns**: When choosing packages from npm, some may not be constantly maintained and may introduce vulnerabilities into your application.\n+  - Developers should evaluate each package carefully.\n+  - Check if packages follow quality and security best practices.\n+\n+## Threads\n+\n+- **Thread**: A path of execution within a process, like a computer program that is currently running.\n+\n+## NVM (Node Version Manager)\n+\n+- **NVM**: A tool for managing multiple versions of Node.js on the same computer.\n+- **Purpose**: Helps you switch between different versions of Node.js for different projects easily.\n+- **Recommendation**: Installing NVM before Node.js is recommended for future flexibility.\n+\n+## Installing NVM on macOS/Linux\n+\n+- **Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS)**: Must be manually installed before running the NVM install script on macOS.\n+\n+```bash\n+xcode-select --install\n+```\n+\n+- **Verify Xcode Installation**:\n+\n+```bash\n+xcode-select --version\n+```\n+\n+- **Download and Execute NVM Installation Script**: Run one of these commands:\n+\n+```bash\n+curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash\n+```\n+\n+```bash\n+wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash\n+```\n+\n+- **Terminal Restart**: You might need to restart your terminal when the process is completed to load the new command and configuration.\n+\n+- **Verify NVM Installation**:\n+\n+```bash\n+nvm -v\n+```\n+\n+## Installing Node.js with NVM on macOS/Linux\n+\n+- **Install Latest LTS Version**: To install the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js:\n+\n+```bash\n+nvm install --lts\n+```\n+\n+- **LTS (Long-Term Support)**: This version is usually recommended because it prioritizes stability, reliability, and security over new or experimental features.\n+  - Thoroughly tested and ready for production.\n+  - Guaranteed to have longer support periods with a focus on bug fixes and security patches.\n+\n+- **Install Specific Version**: You can install a specific version of Node.js by specifying the version number:\n+\n+```bash\n+nvm install <version>\n+```\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+```bash\n+nvm install 20\n+```\n+\n+- **Switch to a Version**:\n+\n+```bash\n+nvm use <version>\n+```\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+```bash\n+nvm use 20\n+```\n+\n+- **Check Current Node.js Version**:\n+\n+```bash\n+node -v\n+```\n+\n+## Installing NVM on Windows\n+\n+- **Official NVM Support**: Official versions of NVM only support Windows in specific cases.\n+  - If you have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can follow the macOS/Linux guide above.\n+\n+- **nvm-windows**: A Node.js version management utility for Windows.\n+  - Completely separate project from the official NVM project.\n+  - Same purpose: help you work with multiple versions of Node.js on the same device.\n+\n+- **Before Installing**: It is recommended to uninstall any prior Node installation before installing NVM for Windows.\n+\n+- **Installation Steps**:\n+  - Go to the Releases section of the official repository: `https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases`.\n+  - Download the latest installer.\n+  - Follow the instructions.\n+\n+- **Terminal Restart**: You might need to restart your terminal if the `nvm` command is not immediately available.\n+\n+- **Verify Installation**:\n+\n+```powershell\n+nvm -v\n+```\n+\n+## Installing Node.js using NVM for Windows\n+\n+- **Install Latest LTS Version**:\n+\n+```powershell\n+nvm install lts\n+```\n+\n+- **Install Specific Version**:\n+\n+```powershell\n+nvm install <version>\n+```\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+```powershell\n+nvm install 20\n+```\n+\n+- **Switch to a Version**:\n+\n+```powershell\n+nvm use <version>\n+```\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+```powershell\n+nvm use 20\n+```\n+\n+- **Check Current Node.js Version**:\n+\n+```bash\n+node -v\n+```\n+\n+## Basic NVM and Node.js Commands\n+\n+- **Note on Commands**: All commands work for NVM installed on macOS/Linux, including WSL.
