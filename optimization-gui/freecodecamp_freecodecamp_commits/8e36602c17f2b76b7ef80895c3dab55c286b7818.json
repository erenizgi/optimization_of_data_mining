It enables you to apply various transformations to elements such as rotating, scaling, skewing, or translating (moving) them in 2D or 3D space.\n \n The `transform` property works by applying a mathematical transformation to an element's coordinate system. This means you can manipulate an element's shape and position while keeping it's original place and document flow intact.\n \n Let's explore some common transform functions. Here's an example of a box element:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+\n+<div class=\"box\"></div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n body {\n   border: 2px solid black;\n@@ -25,10 +33,20 @@ body {\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n We have set the `body` to have a solid black border so that you can see the `.box` element nested inside the `body` element.\n \n The `translate` function moves an element from its current position.
