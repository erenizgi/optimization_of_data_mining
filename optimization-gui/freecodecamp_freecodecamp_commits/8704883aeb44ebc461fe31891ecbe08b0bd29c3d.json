Base pairs are represented by the characters <em>AT</em> and <em>CG</em>, which form building blocks of the DNA double helix.\n+In the double helix of the DNA, the bases are always paired together: if on one strand there is an <em>A</em> base, on the other strand directly in front there is a <em>T</em> base, the other pair is <em>C</em> and <em>G</em>.\n \n In this lab, you will write a function to match the missing base pairs for the provided DNA strand. For each character in the provided string, find the base pair character.\n \n-For example, for the input `GCG`, return `[[\"G\", \"C\"], [\"C\", \"G\"], [\"G\", \"C\"]]`\n+For example, for the input `ATCG`, return `[[\"A\", \"T\"], [\"T\", \"A\"], [\"C\", \"G\"], [\"G\", \"C\"]]`\n \n-The character and its pair are paired up in an array, and all the arrays are grouped into one encapsulating array.\n+The <em>A</em> base gets paired with a <em>T</em> base, the <em>T</em> base is paired with a <em>A</em> base, the <em>C</em> is paired with the <em>G</em> base, and finally the <em>G</em> base is paired with a <em>C</em> base.\n \n **Objective**: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.\n \n **User Stories:**\n \n-1. You should have a `pairElement` function that takes a string as an argument.\n-1. The `pairElement` function should return a 2d array.\n+1. You should have a `pairElement` function that takes a string of any length as an argument.\n+1. The `pairElement` function should return a 2d array, where each inner array has two strings inside, the first string is one base from the input, and the second string the paired base.\n 1. When given `A`, the function should pair it with `T`.\n 1. When given `T`, the function should pair it with `A`.\n 1. When given `C`, the function should pair it with `G`.\n 1. When given `G`, the function should pair it with `C`.\n-1. Each pair should be returned as an array with the original character first and its complement second.\n \n # --hints--\n "
