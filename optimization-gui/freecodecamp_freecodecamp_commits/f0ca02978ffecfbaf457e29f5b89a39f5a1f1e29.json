In the early days of HTML, developers would use elements like the `center`, `big`, and `font` elements. But in modern web development you shouldn't use these types of elements, because of their limitations and negative impact on accessibility and maintainability.\n \n Many presentational HTML elements are deprecated, which means that they are outdated and no longer recommended. There are better ways to get the same results. However, it is helpful to know that they exist, so we'll take a look at some examples.\n \n-The `font` element is a deprecated element used to set the font size and color of the text.

The range for the `size` attribute is from `1` to `7`, with `1` being the smallest and `7` being the largest. The default value is `3`, if you don't set the value explicitly.\n \n While this element still works, you should not use it because the font size and color should always be set in CSS, not in HTML. \n \n-The `center` element is another deprecated element that is used to center the content horizontally within its container.
