For example, the code `print(\"Hello there\"` will lead to a syntax error with the message, `SyntaxError: '(' was never closed`, because the code is missing a closing parenthesis.\n+- **NameError**: Python raises a `NameError` when you try to access a variable or function you have not defined. For instance, if you have the line `print(username)` in your code without having a `username` variable defined first, you will get a name error with the message `NameError: name 'username' is not defined`.\n+- **TypeError**: This is the error Python throws when you perform an operation on two or more incompatible data types. For example, if you try to add a string to a number, you'll get the error `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str`.\n+- **IndexError**: You'll get an `IndexError` if you access an index that does not exist in a list or other sequences like tuple and string. For example, in a `Hello world` string, the index of the last character is `11`. If you go ahead and access a character this way, `greet = \"hello world\"; print(greet[12])`, you'll get an error with the message `IndexError: string index out of range`.\n+- **AttributeError**: Python raises this error when you try to use a method or property that does not exist in an object of that type. For example, calling `.append()` on a string like `\"hello\".append(\"!\")` will lead to an error with the message `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'`.\n \n-## Second topic\n+## Good Debugging Techniques in Python\n \n-Describe\n+- **Using the `print` function**: Inserting `print()` statements around various points in your code while debugging helps you see the values of variables and how your code flows.\n+- **Using Python's Built-in Debugger (`pdb`)**: Python provides a `pdb` module for debugging. It's a part of the Python's standard library, so it's always available to use. With `pdb`, you can set a trace with the `set_trace()` method so you can start stepping through the code and inspect variables in an interactive way.\n+- **Leveraging IDE Debugging Tools**: Many integrated development environments (IDEs) and code editors like Pycharm and VS Code offer debugging tools with breakpoints, step execution, variable inspection, and other debugging features.\n+\n+## Exception Handling\n+\n+- **`try...except`**: This is used to execute a block of code that might raise an exception. The `try` block is  where you anticipate an error might occur, while the `except` block takes a specified exception and runs if that specified error is raised. Here's an example:\n+\n+  ```py\n+  try:\n+    print(22 / 0)\n+  except ZeroDivisionError:\n+    print('You can\\'t divide by zero!')\n+    # You can't divide by zero!\n+  ```\n+\n+  You can also chain multiple `except` blocks so you can handle more types of exceptions:\n+\n+  ```py\n+  try:\n+    number = int(input('Enter a number: '))\n+    print(22 / number)\n+  except ZeroDivisionError:\n+    print('You cannot divide by zero!')\n+    # You cannot divide by zero! prints when you enter 0\n+  except ValueError:\n+    print('Please enter a valid number!')\n+    # Please enter a valid number! prints when you enter a string  \n+  ```\n+\n+- **`else` and `finally`**: These blocks extend `try...except`. If no exception occurs, the `else` block runs. The `finally` block always runs regardless of errors.\n+\n+  ```py\n+  try:\n+    result = 100 / 4\n+  except ZeroDivisionError:\n+    print('You cannot divide by zero!') # This will not run\n+  else:\n+    print(f'Result is {result}') # Result is 25.0\n+  finally:\n+    print('Execution complete!') # Execution complete!\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Exception Object**: This lets you access the exception itself for better debugging and printing the direct error message. To access the exception object, you need to use the `as` keyword. Here's an example:\n+\n+  ```py\n+  try:\n+      value = int('This will raise an error')\n+  except ValueError as e:\n+      print(f'Caught an error: {e}')\n+      # Caught an error: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'This will raise an error'\n+  ```\n+\n+- **The `raise` Statement**: This allows you to manually raise an exception. You can use it to throw an exception when a certain condition is met. Here's an example:\n+\n+  ```py\n+  def divide(a, b):\n+      if b == 0:\n+          raise ZeroDivisionError('You cannot divide by zero')\n+      return a / b\n+  ```\n+  \n+## Exception Signaling\n+  \n+  The `raise` statement is also useful when you create your own custom exceptions, as you can use it to throw an exception with a custom message. Here's an example of that:\n+\n+  ```py\n+  class InvalidCredentialsError(Exception):\n+      def __init__(self, message=\"Invalid username or password\"):\n+          self.message = message\n+          super().__init__(self.message)\n+\n+  def login(username, password):\n+      stored_username = \"admin\"\n+      stored_password = \"password123\"\n+      \n+      if username != stored_username or password != stored_password:\n+          raise InvalidCredentialsError()\n+      \n+      return f\"Welcome, {username}!\"\n+  ```  \n+\n+  Here's a how you can use the `login` function from the `InvalidCredentialsError` exception:\n+\n+  ```py\n+  # failed login attempt\n+  try:\n+      message = login(\"user\", \"wrongpassword\")\n+      print(message)\n+  except InvalidCredentialsError as e:\n+      print(f\"Login failed: {e}\")\n+\n+  # successful login attempt\n+  try:\n+      message = login(\"admin\", \"password123\")\n+      print(message)\n+  except InvalidCredentialsError as e:\n+      # This block is not executed because the login was successful\n+      print(f\"Login failed: {e}\")\n+  else:\n+      # The else block runs if the 'try' block completes without an exception\n+      print(message)\n+  ```\n+\n+  The `raise` statement can also be used with the `from` keyword to chain exceptions, showing the relationship between different errors:\n+\n+  ```py\n+  def parse_config(filename):\n+    try:\n+        with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n+            data = file.read()\n+            return int(data)\n+    except FileNotFoundError:\n+        raise ValueError('Configuration file is missing') from None\n+    except ValueError as e:\n+        raise ValueError('Invalid configuration format') from e\n+\n+  config = parse_config('config.txt')\n+  ```\n \n # --assignment--\n "
