API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs establish a set of rules and protocols that allow software applications to communicate with each other and exchange data efficiently.\n+\n+You can think of them as constructs that allow developers to create more complex functionality based on simpler building blocks that are already implemented.\n+\n+There are various types of APIs. Web APIs are specifically designed for web applications. There are different types of web APIs for client-side JavaScript development. They are not part of JavaScript itself.\n+\n+These types of APIs are often divided into two main categories: browser APIs and third-party APIs.\n+\n+Browser APIs expose data from the browser. As a web developer, you can access and manipulate this data using JavaScript.\n+\n+They also provide access to various functionalities, such as manipulating the structure of the website, handling events, working with storage, and communicating with the network.\n+\n+Some examples of commonly used Browser APIs include:\n+\n+The DOM API, which you can use to manipulate HTML elements, their styles, and attributes. You will learn much more about the DOM in the coming lectures. It’s a core concept in web development.\n+\n+The Storage API, to store data locally on the user’s device.\n+\n+And more. \n+\n+There are various browser APIs that you can use to handle user interactions and to get more information from the browser, like the user's current location. \n+\n+You can also work with other types of elements, such as video and audio.\n+\n+Browser APIs can be helpful tools for building powerful web applications. They already come built into the browser.\n+\n+But you can also use third-party APIs, which are not built into the browser by default. To use them, you need to retrieve their code in some way. Typically, they come with detailed documentation explaining how to use their services.\n+\n+An example is the Google Maps API, which you can use to display interactive maps on your website.\n+\n+There are various types of third-party web APIs, including weather APIs, social media APIs, payment APIs, data APIs, translation APIs, and more. You just need to find the API that fits your needs.\n+\n+Web APIs are essential tools for building modern web applications that can interact with various services and data sources. By learning how to leverage their power, you will expanding your toolset for creating dynamic and engaging websites.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's a programming interface that lets us interact with HTML documents.\n+\n+With the DOM, you can add, modify, or delete elements on a webpage. You can even make your website interactive by making elements listen to and respond to events.\n+\n+In the DOM, an HTML document is represented as a tree of nodes. Each node represents an HTML element from the HTML document:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html lang=\"en\">\n+  <head>\n+    <title>DOM Example</title>\n+  </head>\n+  <body>\n+    <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>\n+    <h2>Let's learn about the DOM</h2>\n+  </body>\n+</html>\n+```\n+\n+This is a diagram representing the basic DOM structure of our example:\n+\n+```md\n+Document\n+========\n+\n+HTML\n+-----\n+\n+- Head\n+  - Title\n+- Body\n+  - H1\n+  - H2   \n+```\n+\n+Of course, this can be more detailed and complex based on the structure of the HTML markup of a webpage.\n+\n+The HTML document is the root node in the DOM hierarchy. It has one child node, the `html` element. This is the root element of the HTML document, since all other nodes descend from it.\n+\n+The `html` element has two children: `head` and `body`.\n+\n+The `head` element contains metadata about the document. It provides essential information about the webpage.\n+\n+The `body` element contains the visible content of the webpage.\n+\n+You can access these elements with JavaScript, work with them in your code, and even modify them dynamically. That's the power of the DOM and web APIs.\n+\n+To access these elements in JavaScript, you can use `getElementById()` and `querySelector()` methods. These methods are web APIs because they provide standardized ways to interact with the DOM using JavaScript.\n+\n+With `getElementById()`, you can get an object that represents the HTML element with the specified `id`. Remember that `id`s must be unique in every HTML document, so this method will only return one `Element` object. Here you can see an example:\n+\n+```js\n+const container = document.getElementById(\"container\");\n+```\n+\n+This line of JavaScript code gets an element with the `id` value of `container` and assigns that object to a JavaScript constant. You must pass the `id` within quotation marks as an argument. If you log this object to the console, you will see it in the output:\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(container); // <div id=\"container\">...</div>\n+```\n+\n+`querySelector()` is broader than `getElementById()`. With `querySelector()`, you can get the first element in the HTML document that matches the CSS selector passed as argument. In this example, you will get the first element with the class `section` and assign it to a variable:\n+\n+```js\n+const section = document.querySelector(\".section\");\n+```\n+\n+You also have other methods to match multiple elements, like `getElementsByClassName()` and `querySelectorAll()`. You'll learn more about them in a coming module.\n+\n+By understanding how to use web APIs to manipulate the DOM efficiently, you can create powerful and interactive web applications.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

We will use this example to illustrate these relationships:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html>\n+  <head>\n+    <title>DOM Tree Example</title>\n+  </head>\n+  <body>\n+    <h1>Heading 1</h1>\n+    <p>Paragraph 1</p>\n+    <ul>\n+      <li>List item 1</li>\n+      <li>List item 2</li>\n+    </ul>\n+  </body>\n+</html>\n+```\n+\n+Let's start at the top. The root of the DOM tree is the `html` element. It's the top-level container for all the content of an HTML document. All other nodes are descendants of this root node.\n+\n+Then, below the root node, we find other nodes in the hierarchy. A parent node is an element that contains other elements. A child node is an element that is contained within another element.\n+\n+In this example, the `body` element is the parent of the paragraph element while the paragraph element is a child of the `body` element. These elements are represented as nodes in the DOM tree with the same relationships.\n+\n+Just like we have parent nodes and child nodes, we also have sibling nodes. Sibling nodes are elements that share the same parent. In our example, two list item elements share the same unordered list parent, so they are siblings. \n+\n+Similarly, the `h1` and paragraph elements are siblings because they share the same parent, the `body` element.\n+\n+We also have indirect relationships across different levels in the hierarchy. Descendant nodes are elements that are contained within another element, either directly or indirectly. An element is considered a descendant of another one if it can be reached by going through the DOM tree downwards from its ancestor.\n+\n+In our example, the list item `li` elements are descendants of the `body` element, since they are indirectly contained within it.\n+\n+An ancestor node is an element that is higher up in the DOM tree hierarchy than another element. In our example, the `body` element is an ancestor of the list item `li` elements.\n+\n+Understanding these relationships is essential for manipulating and navigating the DOM tree using JavaScript.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

You can use this method to get a list of all the DOM elements that match a specific CSS selector.\n+\n+This is how you can call the `querySelectorAll()` method:\n+\n+```js\n+document.querySelectorAll(selectors);\n+```\n+\n+Call it on the `document` object and pass a string with the CSS selectors as an argument. The argument must be a valid CSS selector string. Otherwise, a `SyntaxError` exception will be thrown.\n+\n+`querySelectorAll()` returns a `NodeList` object, a collection of nodes that match the specified CSS selector.\n+\n+The list will contain one `Element` object for each element that matches the CSS selectors. If no matches are found, the list will be empty.\n+\n+The elements will be in the order in which they appear in the HTML document. For example, you can match all elements of a specific type:\n+\n+```js\n+document.querySelectorAll(\"div\");\n+```\n+\n+All elements with a specific class:\n+\n+```js\n+document.querySelectorAll(\".rounded\");\n+```\n+\n+All elements with a specific ID:\n+\n+```js\n+document.querySelectorAll(\"#logo\");\n+```\n+\n+Or all elements with a specific attribute, like all links that take users to a specific URL:\n+\n+```js\n+document.querySelectorAll(\"a[href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/']\");\n+```\n+\n+You can also use more complex CSS selectors, like this one, which matches all list items within an unordered list element with the class `ingredients`:\n+\n+```js\n+document.querySelectorAll(\"ul.ingredients li\");\n+```\n+\n+Since the method will return a collection of nodes, you can assign this collection to a variable and use it in your programs to work with the individual elements, like you can see in this example with the general syntax:\n+\n+```js\n+const matches = document.querySelectorAll(selectors); \n+```\n+\n+For example, if you have this unordered list with three list items:\n+\n+```html\n+<ul class=\"ingredients\">\n+  <li>Flour</li>\n+  <li>Cheese</li>\n+  <li>Water</li>\n+</ul>\n+```\n+\n+You can call the `querySelectorAll()` method to match all list items within the unordered list with the class `ingredients` and assign the return value to the `matches` constant:\n+\n+```js\n+const matches = document.querySelectorAll(\"ul.ingredients li\");\n+```\n+\n+This will return a collection of three nodes. Each node represents a list item element:\n+\n+```js\n+// NodeList(3)\n+{\n+  0: `<li>Flour</li>`,\n+  1: `<li>Cheese</li>`,\n+  2: `<li>Water</li>`,\n+  length: 3,\n+}\n+```\n+\n+You can work with this collection exactly like you would work with any other JavaScript array.\n+\n+For example, you can show it in the console with `console.log()`:\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(matches);\n+```\n+\n+You can also check the length of the collection with the `length` property:\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(matches.length);\n+```\n+\n+The output will be an integer representing the number of nodes in the collection:\n+\n+```md\n+3\n+```\n+\n+You can also access the individual elements of the collection with their corresponding indices. The first element will be at index `0`:\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(matches[0]);\n+console.log(matches[1]);\n+console.log(matches[2]);\n+```\n+\n+This is the output: \n+\n+```html\n+<li>Flour</li>\n+<li>Cheese</li>\n+<li>Water</li>\n+```\n+\n+The elements are printed one by one on the console.\n+\n+You can also iterate over the elements with a `for` loop:\n+\n+```js\n+for (let i = 0; i < matches.length; i++) {\n+  console.log(matches[i]);    \n+}\n+```\n+\n+The output will be exactly the same in this case. But this can be very powerful for working with all the elements of the collection.\n+\n+The `querySelectorAll()` method in JavaScript is a powerful tool for selecting multiple elements based on their CSS selectors. With this method, you can select specific elements within your web pages and manipulate them as needed.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"
