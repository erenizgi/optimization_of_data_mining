The `list()` constructor is used to convert an iterable into a list:\n+\n+```python\n+developer = 'Jessica'\n+\n+print(list(developer)) \n+# Result: ['J', 'e', 's', 's', 'i', 'c', 'a']\n+```\n+\n+- **Finding the Length of a List**: You can use the `len()` function to get the length of a list:\n+\n+```python\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+len(numbers) # 5\n+```\n+\n+- **List Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can update any element in the list as long as you pass in a valid index number. To update lists at a particular index, you can assign a new value to that index:\n+\n+```python\n+programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+programming_languages[0] = 'JavaScript'\n+print(programming_languages) # ['JavaScript', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+```\n+\n+- **Index Out of Range Error**: If you pass in an index (either positive or negative) that is out of bounds for the list, then you will receive an `IndexError`:\n+\n+```python\n+programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+programming_languages[10] = 'JavaScript'\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n+IndexError: list assignment index out of range\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+- **Removing Elements from a List**: Elements can be removed from a list using the `del` keyword:\n+\n+```python\n+developer = ['Jane Doe', 23, 'Python Developer']\n+del developer[1]\n+print(developer) # ['Jane Doe', 'Python Developer']\n+```\n+\n+- **Checking if an Element Exists in a List**: The `in` keyword can be used to check if an element exists in a list:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+\n+'Rust' in programming_languages # True\n+'JavaScript' in programming_languages # False\n+```\n+\n+- **Nesting Lists**: Lists can be nested inside other lists:\n+\n+```python\n+developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]\n+```\n+\n+- To access the nested list, you will need to access it using index `2` since lists are zero-based indexed.\n+\n+```python\n+developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]\n+developer[2] # ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']\n+```\n+\n+- To further access the second language from that nested list, you will need to access it using index `1`:\n+\n+```python\n+developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]\n+developer[2][1] # Rust\n+```\n+\n+- **Unpacking Values from a List:** Unpacking values from a list is a technique used to assign values from a list to new variables. Here is an example to unpack the `developer` list into new variables called `name`, `age` and `job` like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer']\n+name, age, job = developer\n+```\n+\n+- **Collecting Remaining Items From a List**: To collect any remaining elements from a list, you can use the asterisk (`*`) operator like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer']\n+name, *rest = developer\n+```\n+\n+- If the number of variables on the left side of the assignment operator doesn't match the total number of items in the list, then you will receive a `ValueError`.\n+\n+- **Slicing Lists**: Slicing is the concept of accessing a portion of a list by using the slice operator `:`. To slice a list that starts at index `1` and ends at index `3`, you can use the following syntax:\n+\n+```python\n+desserts = ['Cake', 'Cookies', 'Ice Cream', 'Pie']\n+desserts[1:3] # ['Cookies', 'Ice Cream']\n+```\n+\n+- **Step Intervals**: It is also possible to specify a step interval which determines how much to increment between the indices. Here is an example if you want to extract a list of just even numbers using slicing:\n+\n+```python\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n+numbers[1::2] # [2, 4, 6]\n+```\n+\n+## List Methods\n+\n+- **append()**: Used to add an item to the end of the list.

Here is an example of sorting a random list of `numbers` in place:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]\n+numbers.sort()\n+\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 19, 35, 41, 67]\n+```\n+\n+- **sorted()**: Used to sort the elements in a list and return a new sorted list instead of modifying the original list.\n+\n+- **reverse()**: Used to reverse the order of the elements in a list:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n+numbers.reverse()\n+\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n+```\n+\n+- **index()**: Used to find the first index where an element can be found in a list:\n+\n+```python\n+programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']\n+programming_languages.index('Java') # 1\n+```\n+\n+- If the element cannot be found using the `index()` method, then the result will be a `ValueError`.\n+\n+## Tuples in Python\n+\n+- **Definition**: A tuple is a Python data type used to create an ordered sequence of values. Tuples can contain a mixed set of data types:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')\n+```\n+\n+- Tuples are immutable, meaning the elements in the tuple cannot be changed once created. If you try to update one of the items in the tuple, you will get a `TypeError`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages[0] = 'JavaScript'\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n+TypeError: \"tuple\" object does not support item assignment\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+- **Accessing Elements from a Tuple**: To access an element from a tuple, use bracket notation and the index number:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')\n+developer[1] # 34\n+```\n+\n+- Negative indexing can be used to access elements starting from the end of the tuple:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n+numbers[-2] # 4\n+```\n+\n+- If you try to pass in an index number that exceeds or equals the length of the tuple, then you will receive an `IndexError`:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n+numbers[7]\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n+IndexError: tuple index out of range\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+- A tuple can also be created using the `tuple()` constructor. Within the constructor, you can pass in different iterables like strings, lists and even other tuples.\n+\n+```python\n+developer = 'Jessica'\n+\n+print(tuple(developer)) \n+# Result: ('J', 'e', 's', 's', 'i', 'c', 'a')\n+```\n+\n+- **Verifying Items in a Tuple**: To check if an item is in a tuple, you can use the `in` keyword like this:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+\n+'Rust' in programming_languages # True\n+'JavaScript' in programming_languages # False\n+```\n+\n+- **Unpacking Tuples**: Items can be unpacked from a tuple like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')\n+name, age, job = developer\n+```\n+\n+- If you need to collect any remaining elements from a tuple, you can use the asterisk (`*`) operator like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')\n+name, *rest = developer\n+```\n+\n+- **Slicing Tuples**: Slicing can be used to extract a portion of a tuple. For example, the items `pie` and `cookies` can be sliced into a separate tuple:\n+\n+```py\n+desserts = ('cake', 'pie', 'cookies', 'ice cream')\n+desserts[1:3] # ('pie', 'cookies')\n+```\n+\n+- **Removing Items from Tuples**: Removing an item from a tuple will raise a `TypeError` as tuples are immutable:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ('Jane Doe', 23, 'Python Developer')\n+del developer[1]\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n+TypeError: \"tuple\" object doesn't support item deletion\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+- **When to use a Tuple vs a List?**: If you need a dynamic collection of elements where you can add, remove and update elements, then you should use a list. If you know that you are working with a fixed and immutable collection of data, then you should use a tuple.\n+\n+## Common Tuple Methods\n+\n+- **`count()`**: Used to determine how many times an item appears in a tuple. For example, you can check how many times the language `'Rust'` appears in the tuple:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.count('Rust') # 2\n+```\n+\n+- If the specified item in the `count()` function is not present at all in the tuple, then the return value will be `0`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.count('JavaScript') # 0\n+```\n+\n+- If no arguments are passed to the `count()` function, then Python will return a `TypeError`.\n+\n+- **index()**: Used to find the index where a particular item is present in the tuple. Here is an example of using the `index()` method to find the index for the language `'Java'`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.index('Java') # 1\n+```\n+\n+- If the specified item cannot be found, then Python will return a `ValueError`.\n+\n+- You can pass an optional start index to the `index()` method to specify where to start searching for the item in the tuple:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')\n+programming_languages.index('Python', 3) # 5\n+```\n+\n+- You can also pass in an optional end index to the `index()` method to specify where to stop searching for the item in the tuple:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python', 'JavaScript', 'Python')\n+programming_languages.index('Python', 2, 5) # 2\n+```\n+\n+- **`sorted()`**: Used to sort the elements in any iterable and return a new sorted list. Here is an example of creating a new list of numbers using the `sorted()` function:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = (13, 2, 78, 3, 45, 67, 18, 7)\n+sorted(numbers) # [2, 3, 7, 13, 18, 45, 67, 78]\n+```\n+\n+- **Modifying Sorting Behavior**: You can customize the sorting behavior for an iterable using the optional `reverse` and `key` arguments. Here is an example of using the `key` argument to sort items in a tuple by length:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')\n+sorted(programming_languages, key=len)\n+\n+# Result\n+# ['C++', 'Rust', 'Java', 'Rust', 'Python', 'Python']\n+```\n+\n+- You can create a new list of values in reverse order, using the `reverse` argument like this:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')\n+\n+print(sorted(programming_languages, reverse=True))\n+\n+# Result\n+# ['Rust', 'Rust', 'Python', 'Python', 'Java', 'C++']\n+```\n+\n+## Loops in Python\n+\n+- **Definition**: Loops are used to repeat a block of code for a set number of times.\n+\n+- **`for` loop**: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple or string) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence.  Here is an example of using a `for` loop to iterate through a list and print each language to the console:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']\n+\n+for language in programming_languages:\n+    print(language)\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Result \n+\n+Rust\n+Java\n+Python\n+C++\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+- Here is an example of using a `for` loop to loop through the string `code` and print out each character:\n+\n+```py\n+for char in 'code':\n+    print(char)\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Result \n+\n+c\n+o\n+d\n+e\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+- `for` loops can be nested. Here is an example of using a nested `for` loop:\n+\n+```py\n+categories = ['Fruit', 'Vegetable']\n+foods = ['Apple', 'Carrot', 'Banana']\n+\n+for category in categories:\n+    for food in foods:\n+        print(category, food)\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Result\n+\n+Fruit Apple\n+Fruit Carrot\n+Fruit Banana\n+Vegetable Apple\n+Vegetable Carrot\n+Vegetable Banana\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+```\n+\n+- **`while` loop**: Repeats a block of code until the condition is `False`. Here is an example of using a `while` loop for a guessing game:\n+\n+```py\n+secret_number = 3\n+guess = 0\n+\n+while guess != secret_number:\n+    guess = int(input('Guess the number (1-5): '))\n+    if guess != secret_number:\n+        print('Wrong! Try again.')\n+\n+print('You got it!')\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Result\n+\n+Guess the number (1-5): 2\n+Wrong! Try again.\n+Guess the number (1-5): 1\n+Wrong! Try again.\n+Guess the number (1-5): 3\n+You got it!\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+```\n+\n+- **`break` and `continue` statements**: Used in loops to modify the execution of a loop.\n+\n+- The `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately when a certain condition is met. Here is an example of using the `break` statement for a list of `developer_names`:\n+\n+```py\n+developer_names = ['Jess', 'Naomi', 'Tom']\n+\n+for developer in developer_names:\n+    if developer == 'Naomi':\n+        break\n+    print(developer)\n+```\n+\n+- The `continue` statement is used to skip that current iteration and move onto the next iteration of the loop. Here is an example to use the `continue` statement instead of a `break` statement:\n+\n+```py\n+developer_names = ['Jess', 'Naomi', 'Tom']\n+\n+for developer in developer_names:\n+    if developer == 'Naomi':\n+        continue\n+    print(developer)\n+```\n+\n+- Both `for` and `while` loops can be combined with an `else` clause, which is executed only when the loop was not terminated by a `break`:\n+\n+```python\n+words = ['sky', 'apple', 'rhythm', 'fly', 'orange']\n+\n+for word in words:\n+    for letter in word:\n+        if letter.lower() in 'aeiou':\n+            print(f\"'{word}' contains the vowel '{letter}'\")\n+            break\n+    else:\n+        print(f\"'{word}' has no vowels\")\n+```\n+\n+## Ranges and Their Use in Loops\n+\n+- **The `range()` function**: Used to generate a sequence of integers. \n+\n+```py\n+range(start, stop, step)\n+```\n+\n+- The required `stop` argument is an integer(non-inclusive) that represents the end point for the sequence of numbers being generated. Here is an example of using the `range()` function:\n+\n+```py\n+for num in range(3):\n+    print(num)\n+```\n+\n+- If a `start` argument is not specified, then the default will be `0`.  By default the sequence of integers will increment by `1`.  You can use the optional `step` argument to change the default increment value. Here is an example of generating a sequence of even integers from 2 up to but not including 11 (i.e., includes 10)\n+\n+```py\n+for num in range(2, 11, 2):\n+    print(num)\n+```\n+\n+- If you don't provide any arguments to the `range()` function, then you will get a `TypeError`.\n+\n+- The `range()` function only accepts integers for arguments and not floats. Using floats will also result in a `TypeError`:\n+\n+```py\n+ERROR!\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<main.py>\", line 1, in <module>\n+TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer\n+```\n+\n+- You can use a negative integer for the `step` argument to generate a sequence of integers in decrementing order:\n+\n+```py\n+for num in range(40, 0, -10):\n+    print(num)\n+```\n+\n+- The `range()` function can also be used to create a list of integers by using it with the `list` constructor. The `list` constructor is used to convert an iterable into a list. Here is an example of generating a list of even integers between 2 and 10 inclusive:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))\n+print(numbers) # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n+```\n+\n+## `enumerate()` and `zip()` functions in Python\n+\n+- **`enumerate()`**: used to iterate over a sequence and keep track of the index for each item in that sequence. The `enumerate()` function takes an iterable as an argument and returns an `enumerate` object that consist of the index and value of each item in the iterable.\n+\n+```python\n+languages = ['Spanish', 'English', 'Russian', 'Chinese']\n+\n+for index, language in enumerate(languages):\n+    print(f'Index {index} and language {language}')\n+\n+# Result\n+# Index 0 and language Spanish\n+# Index 1 and language English\n+# Index 2 and language Russian\n+# Index 3 and language Chinese\n+\n+```\n+\n+- The `enumerate()` function can also be used outside of a `for` loop:\n+\n+```python\n+languages = ['Spanish', 'English', 'Russian', 'Chinese']\n+\n+print(list(enumerate(languages)))\n+```\n+\n+- The `enumerate()` function also accepts an optional `start` argument that specifies the starting value for the count. If this argument is omitted, then the count will begin at `0`.\n+\n+-  **`zip()`** : Used to iterate over multiple iterables in parallel.  Here's an example using the `zip()` function to iterate over `developers` and `ids`:\n+\n+```python\n+developers = ['Naomi', 'Dario', 'Jessica', 'Tom']\n+ids = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n+\n+for name, id in zip(developers, ids):\n+    print(f'Name: {name}')\n+    print(f'ID: {id}')\n+\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Result\n+\n+Name: Naomi\n+ID: 1\n+Name: Dario\n+ID: 2\n+Name: Jessica\n+ID: 3\n+Name: Tom\n+ID: 4\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+```\n+\n+## List comprehensions in Python\n+\n+- **Definition**: List comprehension allows you to create a new list in a single line by combining the loop and the condition directly within square brackets. This makes the code shorter and often easier to read.\n+\n+```py\n+even_numbers = [num for num in range(21) if num % 2 == 0]\n+print(even_numbers)\n+```\n+\n+## Iterable methods\n+\n+- **`filter()`**: Used to filter elements from an iterable based on a condition. It returns an iterator that contains only the elements that satisfy the condition. Here is an example of creating a new list of just words longer than four characters:\n+\n+```py\n+words = ['tree', 'sky', 'mountain', 'river', 'cloud', 'sun']\n+\n+def is_long_word(word):\n+    return len(word) > 4\n+\n+long_words = list(filter(is_long_word, words))\n+print(long_words) # ['mountain', 'river', 'cloud']\n+```\n+\n+- **`map()`**: Used to apply a function to each item in an iterable and return a new iterable with the results. Here is an example of using the `map()` function to convert a list of celsius temperatures to fahrenheit:\n+\n+```py\n+celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]\n+\n+def to_fahrenheit(temp):\n+    return (temp * 9/5) + 32\n+\n+fahrenheit = list(map(to_fahrenheit, celsius))\n+print(fahrenheit) # [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]\n+```\n+\n+- **`sum()`**: Used to get the sum from an iterable like a list or tuple. Here is an example of using the `sum()` function:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n+total = sum(numbers)\n+print(total) # Result: 50\n+```\n+\n+- You can also pass in an optional `start` argument which sets the initial value for the summation. Here is an updated example using the `start` argument as a positional argument:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n+total = sum(numbers, 10) # positional argument\n+print(total) # 60\n+```\n+\n+- You can also choose to use the `start` argument as a keyword argument like this instead:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n+total = sum(numbers, start=10) # keyword argument\n+print(total) # 60\n+```\n+\n+## Lambda functions\n+\n+- **Definition**: A lambda function in Python is a concise way to create a function without a name (an anonymous function). \n+- Lambda functions are often used as an argument to another function. Here is an example of a lambda function:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+\n+even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n+print(even_numbers)  # [2, 4]\n+```\n+\n+- Best practices for using lambda functions include not assigning them to a variable, keeping them simple and readable, and using them for short, one-off functions.\n \n # --assignment--\n "
