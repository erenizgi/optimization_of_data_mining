And here's an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let phrase = \"JavaScript is awesome!\";\n let result = phrase.includes(\"awesome\");\n \n console.log(result);  // true\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, the word `awesome` is found within the string `JavaScript is awesome!`, so the `includes()` method returns `true`.\n \n It's important to note that the `includes()` method is case-sensitive. This means that the exact match of the characters is required, including their case.\n \n For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let phrase = \"JavaScript is awesome!\";\n let result = phrase.includes(\"Awesome\");\n \n-console.log(result);  // Output: false\n+console.log(result);  // false\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Since `Awesome` (with an uppercase `A`) does not match `awesome` (with a lowercase `a`), the result is `false`.\n \n You can also use the `includes()` method to check for a substring starting at a specific index in the string by providing a second parameter:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let text = \"Hello, JavaScript world!\";\n let result = text.includes(\"JavaScript\", 7);\n \n console.log(result);  // true\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, the search for the substring `JavaScript` starts from the 7th position in the string, ensuring it skips any characters before this position.\n \n The `includes()` method only returns a `true` or `false` result. It does not provide information on where the substring is located in the string or how many times it occurs. If you need that level of detail, other methods, such as the `indexOf()` method might be more suitable."
