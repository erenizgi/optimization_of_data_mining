When you put the `async` keyword before a function, it means that function will always return a `Promise`. Only inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword, which allows you to wait for a `Promise` to resolve before moving on to the next line of code. Here's an example to illustrate how `async`/`await` works:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n async function delayedGreeting(name) {\n   console.log(\"A Messenger entered the chat...\");\n@@ -22,6 +24,8 @@ delayedGreeting(\"Alice\");\n console.log(\"First Printed Message!\");\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this code, we define an `async` function called `delayedGreeting`. Inside this function, we use `await` to pause the execution for 2 seconds. After the delay, it prints a greeting. \n \n When we call this function, you'll see `First Printed Message!` appear before the greeting. This is because the function is asynchronous - it doesn't block the rest of the code from running."
