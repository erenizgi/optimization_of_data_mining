In web development, paths let developers link to resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other web pages. There are absolute and relative paths - both are essential when specifying file locations within a file system. Let's look at the two so you can decide which one of them to use and when.\n \n An absolute path is a complete link to a resource. It starts from the root directory, includes every other directory, and finally the filename and extension. The \"root directory\" refers to the top-level directory or folder in a hierarchy."

But what do these special types of links mean? These are called file paths. There are three key syntaxes to know. First is the slash, which can be a backslash (`\\`) or forward slash (`/`) depending on your operating system. The second is the single dot (`.`). And finally, we have the double dot (`..`).\n \n The slash is known as the \"path separator\". It is used to indicate a break in the text between folder or file names.
