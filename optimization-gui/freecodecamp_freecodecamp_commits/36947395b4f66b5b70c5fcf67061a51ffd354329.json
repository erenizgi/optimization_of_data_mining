The program will allow you to create a character with specific attributes, update those attributes, and retrieve the current stats of the character.\n+\n+**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.\n+\n+**User Stories:**\n+\n+1. Create a class named `GameCharacter` that represents a game character and manages character stats.\n+2. When instantiated, a new `GameCharacter` object should have the following attributes:\n+    - `_name` set to the string given at the moment of the instantiation.\n+    - `_health` set to `100`.\n+    - `_mana` set to `50`.\n+    - `_level` set to `1`.\n+3. Create a `name` property for read-only access to the character's name.\n+4. For the `health` property:\n+     - Define a getter that returns the current health.\n+     - Define a setter that prevents health from being set below `0`, and caps the health at `100`.\n+5. For the `mana` property:\n+     - Define a getter that returns the current mana.\n+     - Define a setter that prevents mana from being set below `0`, and caps the mana at `50`.\n+6. Create a getter for `level` to return the character's current level.\n+7. Define a method named `level_up` that:\n+    - Increases the character's level by 1.\n+    - Resets health to `100` and mana to `50` using their corresponding property setters.\n+    - Prints a message in the form of `<name> leveled up to <level>!` (where `<name>` and `<level>` should be replaced by the character's name and new level, respectively).\n+8. Define a `__str__` method that returns a formatted string including:\n+    - The character's name.\n+    - The character's level.\n+    - The character's current health.\n+    - The character's current mana.\n+   For example, a character named `Kratos`, right after the instantiation, should be represented as the following:\n+\n+   ```md\n+    Name: Kratos\n+    Level: 1\n+    Health: 100\n+    Mana: 50\n+   ```\n+\n+## Usage example\n+\n+```python\n+hero = GameCharacter('Kratos') # Creates a new character named Kratos\n+print(hero)  # Displays the character's stats\n+\n+hero.health -= 30  # Decreases health by 30\n+hero.mana -= 10    # Decreases mana by 10\n+print(hero)  # Displays the updated stats\n+\n+hero.level_up()  # Levels up the character\n+print(hero)  # Displays the stats
