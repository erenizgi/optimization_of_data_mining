One such surprise occurs when you mix numbers and strings in calculations. The first thing you'll probably try is to add a number and a string. In JavaScript, the `+` operator does double duty. It handles both addition and string concatenation, which is a way to join two strings together.\n \n When you use `+` with a number and a string, JavaScript decides to treat them both as strings and joins them together. If you check the type of the result with the `typeof` operator, you'd see it's indeed a string:"

Binary is a number system that uses only these two digits to represent all numbers. \n \n For example, the binary representation of the decimal number `10` is `1010`.
