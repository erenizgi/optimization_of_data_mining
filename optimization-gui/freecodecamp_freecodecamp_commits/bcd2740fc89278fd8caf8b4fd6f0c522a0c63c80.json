There are four main methods for adding and removing elements from the beginning and end of an array: `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()`. Let's explore each of these methods in detail.\n \n The `push()` method is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array. The return value for the `push()` method is the new length of the array. Here's an example of adding a new fruit to the existing `fruits` array:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"];\n const newLength = fruits.push(\"orange\");\n console.log(newLength); // 3\n console.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we start with an array called `fruits` which contains two elements. We then use the `push()` method to add the string `orange` to the end of the array.\n \n You might have noticed that we are using `const` when declaring the `fruits` array. But why is it possible to add more elements to this `fruits` array when `fruits` is a constant? This is possible because declaring an array with the `const` keyword creates a reference to the array. While the array itself is mutable and can be modified, you cannot reassign a new value to the `fruits` constant, like this:\n@@ -30,35 +34,47 @@ console.log(fruits); // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.\n \n The next method we will look at is the `pop()` method. The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. It also modifies the original array. Here's how it works:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"];\n let lastFruit = fruits.pop();\n console.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\n console.log(lastFruit); // \"orange\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we start with an array of three fruits. The `pop()` method removes the last element (`orange`) from the array and returns it. The original `fruits` array is modified and contains only two elements.\n \n The `unshift()` method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns its new length. It works similarly to `push()`, but modifies the start of the array instead of the end. Here's an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let numbers = [2, 3];\n let newLength = numbers.unshift(1);\n console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]\n console.log(newLength); // 3\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we use `unshift()` to add the number `1` to the beginning of the `numbers` array. The method returns the new length of the array, which is `3`.\n \n Finally, the `shift()` method removes the first element from an array and returns that element. It's similar to `pop()`, but it works at the beginning of the array instead of the end. Here's how it works:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"];\n let firstColor = colors.shift();\n console.log(colors); // [\"green\", \"blue\"]\n console.log(firstColor); // \"red\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we start with an array of three colors. The `shift()` method removes the first element (`red`) from the array and returns it. The original `colors` array is modified to contain only two elements.\n \n Note that while `push()` and `unshift()` can add multiple elements at once, `pop()` and `shift()` remove only one element at a time."
