This includes variables, functions, objects, basically everything your code creates and uses. Memory management is the process of controlling this memory, allocating it when needed, and freeing it up when it's no longer needed. In some programming languages, developers have to manually manage memory. They need to explicitly tell the computer when to allocate memory for new things and when to free up memory that's no longer needed. This can be powerful but also tricky as forgetting to free memory can lead to memory leaks.\n@@ -38,7 +31,7 @@ let printArrayLength = createLargeArray();\n printArrayLength();\n ```\n \n-In this code, even after `createLargeArray` finishes running, `largeArray` can't be garbage collected because the returned function still has access to it.

However, as you advance in your JavaScript journey, understanding these concepts can help you write more efficient code, especially for larger applications or when working with limited resources. \n "
