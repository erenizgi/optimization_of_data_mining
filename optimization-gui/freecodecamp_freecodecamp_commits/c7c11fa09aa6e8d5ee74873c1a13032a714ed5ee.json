This creates an independent copy of the value. As a result, any changes made to the original variable (`num1`) do not affect the copy (`num2`).\n \n Non-primitive data types, on the other hand, are more complex. In JavaScript, these are objects, which include regular objects, arrays, and functions. Unlike primitives, non-primitive types can hold multiple values as properties or elements. \n \n When you create a variable with a non-primitive value, what's stored in the variable is actually a reference to the location in memory where the object is stored, not the object itself. This leads to some important differences in behavior.
