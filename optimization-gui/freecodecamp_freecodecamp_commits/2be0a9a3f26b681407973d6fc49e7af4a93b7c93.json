For now, just consider strings as a sequence of characters surrounded by either single (`'`) or double (`\"`) quotation marks.\n \n-There's a lot more to the `print` function than first meets the eye. There are four other arguments you can pass to it, so here's the full syntax of the function:\n+In the `print('Hello world!')` example, the string `'Hello world!'` is an **argument** passed to the `print` function. You can also use the `print` function to show multiple values, or arguments, at once by separating them with commas. For example:\n \n ```python\n-print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)\n-```\n-\n-Note that each of the arguments must be separated by a comma, otherwise you'll get a syntax error. Here are more details about each argument:\n-\n-- `objects`: The data you want to print. The `*` sign means that you can print multiple things to the terminal by passing in multiple objects (in other words, strings, variables, numbers, and so on) separated by commas.    \n-- `sep=' '`: The separator between the objects. This defaults to a single space character (`' '`).\n-- `end='\\n'`: What to print at the end of the object. This defaults to a new line character (`'\\n'`).\n-- `file=sys.stdout`: Determines where to send the output. The default is the terminal, but it can be a file.\n-- `flush=False`: Determines whether to show the output data right away. The default is `False`, which means Python may wait before displaying the output.\n-    \n-You might be wondering how the other arguments outside of `object` are useful. Let's take a look at some common use cases.\n-\n-If you print multiple things at once, they're just separated by spaces by default. For example:\n-\n-```python\n-print('Footballers:', 'Ronaldo', 'Messi', 'Hazard', 'Kante', 'Okocha')\n-\n-# Output: Footballers: Ronaldo Messi Hazard Kante Okocha\n-```\n-\n-But you can use another separator of your choice with the `sep` argument:\n-\n-```python\n-print('Footballers:', 'Ronaldo', 'Messi', 'Hazard', 'Kante', 'Okocha', sep=', ')\n-\n-# Output: Footballers:, Ronaldo, Messi, Hazard, Kante, Okocha\n-```\n-\n-In this example, you passed a comma followed by a single space character to `sep`. But the comma in front of the first value, `Footballers:` doesn't make sense, right?\n-\n-To get rid of that comma, you can move the space to the `Footballers:` string directly, and use a plus sign (`+`):\n-\n-```python\n-print('Footballers: ' + 'Ronaldo', 'Messi', 'Hazard', 'Kante', 'Okocha', sep=', ')\n-\n-# Output: Footballers: Ronaldo, Messi, Hazard, Kante, Okocha\n-```\n-\n-This is called string concatenation, which is when you combine multiple strings into one. In this case, you're combing the strings `Footballers:` and `Ronaldo` first, resulting in `Footballers: Ronaldo`, before printing everything to the terminal.\n-\n-You'll learn more about string concatenation in future lessons.\n-\n-The `end` parameter lets you avoid a common issue with the `print` function, where it automatically prints a new line when you have multiple of it. Here's an example:\n-\n-The `end` parameter lets you modify the ending of the output. By default, the end character is a newline character (`\\n`), which is helpful in most cases.\n-\n-But what if you call `print` multiple times in a row?\n+print('My favorite colors are', 'blue', 'green', 'red')\n \n-```python\n-print('Footballers:')\n-print('Ronaldo')\n-print('Messi')\n-print('Hazard')\n-print('Kante')\n-print('Okocha')\n-\n-# Output:\n-# Footballers:\n-# Ronaldo\n-# Messi\n-# Hazard\n-# Kante\n-# Okocha\n-```\n-\n-To avoid this common issue, you can specify a different value for the `end` argument:\n-\n-```python\n-print('Footballers:', end=' ')\n-print('Ronaldo', end=', ')\n-print('Messi', end=', ')\n-print('Hazard', end=', ')\n-print('Kante', end=', ')\n-print('Okocha', end='.')\n-\n-# Output: Footballers: Ronaldo, Messi, Hazard, Kante, Okocha.\n+# Output: My favorite colors are blue green red\n ```\n \n-How cool is that?\n-\n-Here's how you can use the `file` argument to write the output of the `print` function to a separate file:\n+Python automatically adds a space between each item when you separate them with commas. This is helpful when you want to print several pieces of information together.\n \n-```python\n-with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:\n-   print('Hello world!', file=f)\n-```\n-\n-This will print the text `Hello world!` into a file named `output.txt`. If the file doesn't exist, it will be automatically created. You will learn more about how working with the filesystem in future lessons.\n+# --questions--\n \n-The last argument of the `print` function we showed in its basic syntax is `flush`. When set to `True`, it immediately shows what you want to print instead of waiting for a short time.\n+## --text--\n \n-The last argument is `flush`. When this is set to `True`, whatever you're outputting is shown immediately rather than waiting for potential delays in the program's execution:\n+Why does the following code print all the values on the same line with spaces?\n \n ```python\n-import time\n-\n-print('Processing...', end=' ', flush=True)\n-time.sleep(2)\n-print('Done!')\n+print('My favorite colors are', 'blue', 'green', 'red')\n ```\n \n-In this case, the `Processing…` text immediately appears in the terminal, then `time.sleep(2)` delays the `Done` text from appearing for 2 seconds. This makes `flush` a great tool for displaying progress bars and loading text.\n-\n-And that's how the `print` function works!\n-\n-# --questions--\n-\n-## --text--\n+## --answers--\n \n-What are the arguments of the `print()` function in Python?\n+Because separating values with commas in `print()` adds spaces between them.\n \n-## --answers--\n+---\n \n-`objects`, `delimiter`, `newline`, `output`, `buffer`\n+Because strings are automatically joined together with no separator.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about the arguments that control formatting, output location, and buffering behavior.\n+Review how Python formats output when multiple values are passed to `print()`.\n \n ---\n \n-`data`, `separator`, `terminator`, `destination`, `force_output`\n+Because each call to `print()` adds a space by default.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about the arguments that control formatting, output location, and buffering behavior.\n+Review how Python formats output when multiple values are passed to `print()`.\n \n ---\n \n-`values`, `splitter`, `stop`, `stream`, `immediate`\n+Because Python automatically converts all strings to uppercase in output.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about the arguments that control formatting, output location, and buffering behavior.\n-\n----\n-\n-`objects`, `sep`, `end`, `file`, `flush`\n+Review how Python formats output when multiple values are passed to `print()`.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-4\n+1\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What's one problem the `end` argument of the `print()` function lets you avoid?\n+What would the output of the following code be?\n \n-## --answers--\n-\n-It prevents print statements from adding an extra space between words.\n+```python\n+print('Hello', 'world!')\n+```\n \n-### --feedback--\n+## --answers--\n \n-Think about how `print()` moves to the next line after execution.\n+`Hello world!`\n \n ---\n \n-It stops print statements from printing in reverse order.\n+`Helloworld!`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about how `print()` moves to the next line after execution.\n+Think about how multiple arguments are handled in the `print()` function.\n \n ---\n \n-It prevents print statements from automatically printing a new line.\n+`Hello, world!`\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Think about how multiple arguments are handled in the `print()` function.\n \n ---\n \n-It stops print statements from printing duplicate values.\n+`Hello\\nworld!`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about how `print()` moves to the next line after execution.\n+Think about how multiple arguments are handled in the `print()` function.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-3\n+1\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What happens when the `flush` argument is set to `True` in the `print()` function?\n+What is the purpose of the quotation marks around `Hello world!` in the following code?\n+\n+```python\n+print('Hello world!')\n+```\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-The output is printed in uppercase letters.\n+They define a string to be printed by the `print()` function.\n \n-### --feedback--\n+---\n \n-Think about how Python may delay showing output.\n+They are used to call a function named `Hello world!`.\n \n----\n+### --feedback--\n \n-The output is immediately displayed instead of being buffered.\n+Consider how Python identifies string values in code.\n \n ---\n \n-The print statement runs twice for the same output.\n+They are required only if the string contains spaces.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about how Python may delay showing output.\n+Consider how Python identifies string values in code.\n \n ---\n \n-The output is saved to a file instead of being printed to the console.\n+They let Python know to print a variable named `Hello world!`.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about how Python may delay showing output.\n+Consider how Python identifies string values in code.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-2\n+1"
