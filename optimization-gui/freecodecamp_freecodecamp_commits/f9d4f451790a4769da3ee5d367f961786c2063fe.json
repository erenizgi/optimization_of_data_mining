This helps people using assistive technologies understand the content of your website.\n-- **Accessibility and Tables**: When using tables, you should use the `th` element to define header cells and the `td` element to define data cells. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the structure of the table. With the `caption` element, you can write the caption (or title) of a table, so users, especially those who use assistive technologies, can quickly understand the table's purpose and content. You should place the `caption` element immediately after the opening tag of the `table `element. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can provide more context by announcing the caption before reading the content.\n+- **Accessibility and Tables**: When using tables, you should use the `th` element to define header cells and the `td` element to define data cells.
