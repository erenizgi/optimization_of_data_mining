We're thrilled to have you here. This program is all about guiding you **step by step** as you build real, practical Chinese skills from the ground up that you can use in professional settings.\n+\n+Here's the breakdown of how the certification is structured and how you'll learn:\n+\n+## Chapters and Modules\n+\n+The entire certification is divided into **chapters**, and each chapter contains several **modules**. You can think of a chapter as a major topic and a module as a specific, focused lesson within that topic.\n+\n+Every **module** focuses on a specific communication goal based on different professional situations. To help you get into a smooth learning rhythm, the modules will often follow the same structure:\n+\n+1.  **Warm-up:** You'll start by meeting new **words and phrases** or reviewing content that's relevant to the module. You'll complete short tasks to recognize and get familiar with the key vocabulary.\n+2.  **Learn:** This is where you see the new words in action! You'll listen to short **monologues or dialogues** and answer questions to understand their meaning and how they're used in real conversations.\n+3.  **Practice:** Time to try it out! You'll complete more open-ended tasks that test your comprehension and your ability to write in Chinese.\n+4.  **Review:** At the end of each module, you'll find a **grammar summary** and a **glossary**. These are super useful reference tools you can use to reinforce what you've learned and revisit later if you need a quick refresher.\n+5.  **Quiz:** Finally, there's a short quiz to assess what you remember. Quizzes usually include **10 to 20 questions** and are designed to test your knowledge without hints. Don't worry, you can retake them as many times as you need, and your score is completely private.\n+\n+## Learn at Your Own Pace\n+\n+This certification is **self-paced**, which means you are **free to learn on your own schedule**. Whether you power through it on a weekend or do a little bit each day, it's completely up to you!\n+\n+If you ever get stuck or just need a little support, you can click on the **Ask for Help** button. That will connect you with other learners in the forum where you can ask questions and help each other out.\n+\n+# --assignment--\n+\n+I've read \"How the Certification Works\" article."

In this curriculum, you will learn **Mandarin**, the most widely used standard form of spoken Chinese.\n+\n+Chinese is written in two major forms: Simplified and Traditional Chinese. This curriculum will focus on **Simplified Chinese**.\n+\n+Since Chinese characters are not phonetic, a system called **Pinyin**​ is used to represent their sounds. Pinyin is a romanization system that uses the Latin alphabet to indicate how Chinese characters are pronounced. It serves as an essential tool for beginners to learn the pronunciation of the language and to type Chinese on digital devices.\n+\n+In the audio, Wang Hua is saying \"Hello, world.\" in Chinese. You're about to input your first two Chinese words, each made of two characters. Sounds unbelievable, right? freeCodeCamp has customized the **Pinyin-Tone Input** and **Pinyin-Hanzi Input** to help you do this easily.\n+\n+Try typing `ni3 hao3` and `shi4 jie4` to see what happens.

They type only the initial and final, and then select the correct character from a list.\n+\n+However, typing and seeing tone marks helps beginners build and strengthen the memory of Chinese characters.\n+\n+With the Pinyin-Tone input, you can type the letters plus a tone number to automatically convert them into tone-marked Pinyin. For example, here, `ni3 hao3` becomes `nǐ hǎo`, and `shi4 jie4` becomes `shì jiè`.\n+\n+You will use this input frequently when learning Pinyin in Chapter 2 of this curriculum.\n+\n+# --scene--\n+\n+```json\n+{\n+  \"setup\": {\n+    \"background\": \"company1-reception.png\",\n+    \"characters\": [\n+      {\n+        \"character\": \"Wang Hua\",\n+        \"position\": {\n+          \"x\": 50,\n+          \"y\": 15,\n+          \"z\": 1.4\n+        },\n+        \"opacity\": 0\n+      }\n+    ],\n+    \"audio\": {\n+      \"filename\": \"ZH_A1_welcome_hello_world.mp3\",\n+      \"startTime\": 1,\n+      \"startTimestamp\": 5.18,\n+      \"finishTimestamp\": 6.71\n+    }\n+  },\n+  \"commands\": [\n+    {\n+      \"character\": \"Wang Hua\",\n+      \"opacity\": 1,\n+      \"startTime\": 0\n+    },\n+    {\n+      \"character\": \"Wang Hua\",\n+      \"startTime\": 1,\n+      \"finishTime\": 2.53,\n+      \"dialogue\": {\n+        \"text\": \"你好 (nǐ hǎo)，世界 (shì jiè)。\",\n+        \"align\": \"center\"\n+      }\n+    },\n+    {\n+      \"character\": \"Wang Hua\",\n+      \"opacity\": 0,\n+      \"startTime\": 3.03\n+    }\n+  ]\n+}\n+```"
