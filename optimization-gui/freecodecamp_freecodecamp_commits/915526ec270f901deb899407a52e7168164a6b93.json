CSS Grid simplifies this process by dividing your web page into rows and columns, creating a grid-like structure.\n+\n+Let's imagine you were working with a container `div` with several items nested inside like this:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"container\">\n+  <div class=\"item\">Item 1</div>\n+  <div class=\"item\">Item 2</div>\n+  <div class=\"item\">Item 3</div>\n+  <div class=\"item\">Item 4</div>\n+  <div class=\"item\">Item 5</div>\n+  <div class=\"item\">Item 6</div>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+If you wanted to style those elements in a grid format, you can set the `display` to `grid` and apply columns like this:\n+\n+```css\n+.container {\n+  display: grid;\n+  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n+  grid-gap: 20px;\n+}\n+\n+.item {\n+  background-color: lightgray;\n+  padding: 20px;\n+  text-align: center;\n+  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this code, we're telling the browser to create a grid with three equal-width columns, that's what the `1fr 1fr 1fr` means, and we're adding a 20-pixel gap between each grid item.\n+\n+Now, you might be wondering: \"What about Flexbox? Isn't that also used for layouts?\"\n+\n+You're right! Flexbox is another CSS layout model, and it's quite useful too. But there are some key differences.\n+\n+Flexbox is one-dimensional, while Grid is two-dimensional. This means Flexbox works great for laying things out in a single row or column, while Grid excels at creating layouts with both rows and columns.\n+\n+Flexbox is content-first, meaning it adjusts the layout based on the content. Grid, on the other hand, is layout-first, allowing you to create the layout and then place items into it. Grid gives you more precise control over placement. You can tell an item exactly which row and column to occupy.\n+\n+Here's a Flexbox example for comparison:\n+\n+```css\n+.container {\n+  display: flex;\n+  justify-content: space-between;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This creates a flex container where the items are spaced evenly along the main axis.\n+\n+Both Grid and Flexbox have their strengths, and often, the best layouts use a combination of both. You might use Grid for the overall page layout, and then use Flexbox for aligning items within each grid area.\n+\n+In summary, CSS Grid is a powerful tool that allows for precise, two-dimensional layouts. While it might seem complex at first, with practice, it becomes an invaluable tool for creating responsive and complex web layouts.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

In this video, we will explore how to create flexible grid layouts using the `fr` unit.\n+\n+Let's start with this HTML markup which is going to represent our grid container:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"grid-container\">\n+  <div class=\"col\"></div>\n+  <div class=\"col\"></div>\n+  <div class=\"col\"></div>\n+  <div class=\"col\"></div>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+Inside the CSS, we set the display property to grid for the container.\n+\n+```css\n+html,\n+body {\n+  width: 100%;\n+  height: 100%;\n+}\n+\n+.grid-container {\n+  display: grid;\n+  grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25%;\n+  gap: 15px;\n+  background-color: darkgray;\n+  height: 100%;\n+}\n+\n+.col {\n+  background-color: darkslateblue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+`grid-template-columns` is used to set the size for each column. In this case, each column size will be `25%` of the container. Then the gap property is used to create space around each column.\n+\n+So far we have been using percentages for the column size but we can also use the `fr` unit.\n+\n+The `fr` unit is a fractional unit which represents a fraction of the space for the grid container.\n+\n+Here is what the code will look like when it is refactored to use `fr` units instead of percentages.\n+\n+```css\n+html,\n+body {\n+  width: 100%;\n+  height: 100%;\n+}\n+\n+.grid-container {\n+  display: grid;\n+  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n+  gap: 15px;\n+  background-color: darkgray;\n+  height: 100%;\n+}\n+\n+.col {\n+  background-color: darkslateblue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Each column will take up one fraction of the available space. Since there are four columns, each column will have an equal share of the space available in the grid container.\n+\n+As you start to build your grid layouts, you will find yourself wanting to use `fr` units more often because they provide a flexible, proportional way to distribute space, allowing you to create responsive layouts that adapt to varying screen sizes without needing to manually adjust pixel values.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

But in this video, we will dive into more detail about how to use the `row-gap`, `column-gap` and `gap` properties in a grid layout.\n+\n+But first we need to review what a track is in CSS grid. A track is the space between two neighboring grid lines. These lines are automatically created when you use CSS Grid. In this context, tracks generally refer to the rows and columns that make up the grid layout.\n+\n+To create gaps between columns in a CSS Grid, you can use the `column-gap` property. Acceptable values for this property include pixels, the `em` unit, percentages, or the `normal` keyword.\n+\n+If you use the `normal` value for the `column-gap` property, then the result will be `0` for grid layouts and `1em` for multi-column layouts.\n+\n+Here is an example of the markup for a four column grid layout:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"grid-container\">\n+  <div></div>\n+  <div></div>\n+  <div></div>\n+  <div></div>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+For the CSS, we set the display to grid and the `column-gap` property to 10 pixels:\n+\n+```css\n+.grid-container {\n+  display: grid;\n+  height: 100px;\n+  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n+  column-gap: 10px;\n+}\n+\n+.grid-container div {\n+  background-color: darkblue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+If we wanted to change the example to have two rows of blue boxes and create more space between the rows, we can use the `row-gap` property:\n+\n+```css\n+.grid-container {\n+  display: grid;\n+  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n+  column-gap: 10px;\n+  row-gap: 30px;\n+}\n+\n+.grid-container div {\n+  height: 100px;\n+  background-color: darkblue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this revised example, we are setting the `row-gap` property to 30 pixels and changing the `grid-template-columns` to use just two `1fr` units instead of four to create two rows of boxes.\n+\n+Just like the `column-gap` property, acceptable values for the `row-gap` property can include percentages, `em`, and pixels.\n+\n+If you want to use a shorthand for creating gaps between rows and columns, you can use the `gap` property. Here is the basic syntax:\n+\n+```css\n+gap: row-value optional-column-value;\n+```\n+\n+If you specify one value for the `gap` property, then that value will be applied to both rows and columns. If you specify two values, then the first value will go to the row and the second will be applied to the column:\n+\n+```css\n+.grid-container {\n+  display: grid;\n+  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n+  gap: 30px 10px;\n+}\n+\n+.grid-container div {\n+  height: 100px;\n+  background-color: darkblue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Acceptable values for the `gap` shorthand property include percentages, pixels, `em` and even `calc()` values. But you cannot use `fr` units here.\n+\n+The `row-gap`, `column-gap`, and `gap` properties provide flexible ways to control spacing between items in a CSS Grid layout. By using these properties, you can easily create visually appealing grids with consistent and adjustable gaps between rows and columns.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n@@ -58,23 +141,23 @@ The `gap` between columns is set to 10\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed. \n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n The `gap` between columns is set to -1\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed. \n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n The `gap` between columns is set to 14\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed. \n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n@@ -94,23 +177,23 @@ Which of the following is the correct property used as a shorthand for creating\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video where the correct property is discussed. \n+Review the end of the video where the correct property is discussed.\n \n ---\n \n `space` property\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video where the correct property is discussed. \n+Review the end of the video where the correct property is discussed.\n \n ---\n \n `rowGapColumnGap` property\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video where the correct property is discussed. \n+Review the end of the video where the correct property is discussed.\n \n ---\n "
