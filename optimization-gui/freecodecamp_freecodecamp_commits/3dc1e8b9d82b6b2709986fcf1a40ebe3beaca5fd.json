Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the data.\n+- **Advantages of Relational Databases**: Scalable, widely applicable across domains (e.g., healthcare, business, gaming), and structured to maintain reliable data.\n+- **Common Use Cases**: Web development, inventory systems, e-commerce, healthcare, and enterprise applications.\n+\n+## Key Concepts\n+\n+- **Schema**: A relational database requires a schema that defines its structure—tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.\n+- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for each row in a table. They are essential for data integrity and are used to relate records between tables via foreign keys.\n+- **Foreign Keys**: References to primary keys in another table, used to link related data across tables.\n+- **Relationships**: By connecting tables through primary and foreign keys, you can structure normalized data and perform meaningful queries.\n+- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: Visualize how entities (tables) relate to each other in a database schema.\n+- **Data Integrity**: Enforced using keys and data types. Ensures consistency and accuracy of stored data.\n+\n+## SQL Basics\n+\n+- **Queries**: Requests to retrieve specific data from the database.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE age < 3;\n+```\n+\n+- **WHERE clause**: Filter results based on conditions. Use comparison operators like `<`, `=`, `>`, etc.\n+- **Select with ORDER BY**: Retrieve and sort results based on a column.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY

Non-Relational\n+\n+- **Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases**: Store unstructured or semi-structured data. Do not require a rigid schema and are more flexible for evolving data models.\n+- **Choosing Between Relational and Non-Relational**: Depends on the nature of your data and application requirements.\n+- **Relational vs Non-Relational**: Choose relational for structured data and consistency; NoSQL for flexibility and fast-changing data.\n+\n+## Popular RDBMS Systems\n+\n+- **MySQL**: Open-source, reliable, widely used in web development, supported by a large community.\n+- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, advanced, extensible. Supports custom data types and server-side programming.\n+- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based, serverless. Ideal for small applications.\n+- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Proprietary, enterprise-grade database.\n+- **Oracle Database**: Commercial RDBMS known for large-scale performance and scalability.\n+\n+## Best Practices\n+\n+- **Naming Convention**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `delivery_orders`) for table and column names.\n+\n+## Bash Scripting Basics\n+\n+- **Bash scripting**: Writing a sequence of Bash commands in a file, which you can then execute with Bash to run the contents of the file.\n+- **Shebang**: The commented line at the beginning of a script (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) that indicates what interpreter should be used for the script.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  #!/bin/bash\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Variable assignment**: Instantiate variables using the syntax `variable_name=value`.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  servers=(\"prod\" \"dev\")\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Variable creation rules**: Create variables with `VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE` syntax. No spaces are allowed around the equal sign (`=`). Use double quotes if the value contains spaces.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  NAME=John\n+  MESSAGE=\"Hello World\"\n+  COUNT=5\n+  TEXT=\"The next number is, \"\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Variable usage**: Access variable values by placing `$` in front of the variable name.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  echo $NAME\n+  echo \"The message is: $MESSAGE\"\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Variable interpolation**: Use `$variable_name` to access the value of a variable within strings and commands.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  TEXT=\"The next number is, \"\n+  NUMBER=42\n+  echo $TEXT B:$NUMBER\n+  echo $TEXT I:$NUMBER\n+  \n+  echo \"Pulling $server\"\n+  rsync --archive --verbose $server:/etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf configs/$server.conf\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Variable scope**: Shell scripts run from top to bottom, so variables can only be used below where they are created.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  NAME=\"Alice\"\n+  echo $NAME\n+  ```\n+\n+- **User input**: Use `read` to accept input from users and store it in a variable.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  read USERNAME\n+  echo \"Hello $USERNAME\"\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Comments**: Add comments to your scripts using `#` followed by your comment text.\n+  - Single-line comments start with `#` and continue to the end of the line\n+  - Comments are ignored by the shell and don't affect script execution\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  # This is a single-line comment\n+  NAME=\"John\"  # Comment at end of line\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Multi-line comments**: Comment out blocks of code using colon and quotes.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  : '\n+  This is a multi-line comment\n+  Everything between the quotes is ignored\n+  Useful for debugging or documentation\n+  '\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Built-in commands and help**: \n+  - Use `help` to see a list of built-in bash commands\n+  - Use `help <command>` to get information about specific built-in commands\n+  - Some commands (like `if`) are built-ins and don't have man pages\n+  - Built-in commands are executed directly by the shell rather than as external programs\n+  - Use `help function` to see information about creating functions\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  help\n+  help if\n+  help function\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Finding command locations**: Use `which` to locate where executables are installed.\n+  - Shows the full path to executable files\n+  - Useful for finding interpreter locations (like bash)\n+  - Helps verify which version of a command will be executed\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  which bash\n+  which python\n+  which ls\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Manual pages**: Use `man` to access detailed documentation for commands.\n+  - Provides comprehensive information about command usage\n+  - Shows all available options and examples\n+  - Use arrow keys to navigate, 'q' to quit\n+  - Not all commands have manual pages (built-ins use `help` instead)\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  man echo\n+  man ls\n+  man bash\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Help flags**: Many commands support `--help` for quick help information.\n+  - Alternative to manual pages for quick reference\n+  - Shows command syntax and common options\n+  - Not all commands support this flag (some may show error)\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  ls --help\n+  chmod --help\n+  mv --help\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Echo command options**: The `echo` command supports various options:\n+  - `-e` option enables interpretation of backslash escapes\n+  - `\\n` creates a new line\n+  - Empty lines are only printed when values are enclosed in quotes\n+  - Useful for creating formatted output and program titles\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  echo -e \"Line 1\\nLine 2\"\n+  echo \"\"\n+  echo -e \"\\n~~ Program Title ~~\\n\"\n+  echo \"Line 1\\nLine 2\"\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Script arguments**: Programs can accept arguments that are accessible using `$` variables.\n+  - `$*` prints all arguments passed to the script\n+  - `$@` prints all arguments passed to the script as separate quoted strings\n+  - `$<number>` accesses specific arguments by position (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, `$3`)\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  echo $*\n+  echo $@\n+  echo $1\n+  echo $2\n+  ```\n+\n+## Double Bracket Expressions `[[ ]]`\n+\n+- **Double bracket syntax**: Use `[[ ]]` for conditional testing and pattern matching.\n+  - Must have spaces inside the brackets and around operators\n+  - Returns exit status 0 (true) or 1 (false) based on the test result\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  [[ $variable == \"value\" ]]\n+  [[ $number -gt 10 ]]\n+  [[ -f filename.txt ]]\n+  ```\n+\n+- **String comparison operators**: Compare strings using various operators within `[[ ]]`.\n+  -

First character (`-`): File type (- for regular file, d for directory)\n+  - Next 9 characters: Permissions for owner, group, and others\n+  - `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute\n+  \n+- **Adding executable permissions**: Use `chmod +x` to give executable permissions to everyone.\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  chmod +x questionnaire.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Script organization**: Best practices for structuring bash scripts.\n+  - Start with shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)\n+  - Add descriptive comments about script purpose\n+  - Define variables at the top\n+  - Group related functions together\n+  - Main script logic at the bottom\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  #!/bin/bash\n+  NAME=\"value\"\n+  ARRAY=(\"item1\" \"item2\")\n+  my_function() {\n+      echo \"Function code here\"\n+  }\n+  my_function\n+  echo \"Script complete\"\n+  ```\n+\n+- **Sequential script execution**: Create master scripts that run multiple programs in sequence.\n+  - Useful for automating workflows that involve multiple scripts\n+  - Each script runs to completion before the next one starts\n+  - Can combine different programs into a single execution flow\n+  - Arguments can be passed to individual scripts as needed\n+  - Can include different types of programs (interactive, automated, etc.)\n+\n+  ```bash\n+  #!/bin/bash\n+  ./setup.sh\n+  ./interactive.sh\n+  ./processing.sh\n+  ./cleanup.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+## Database Normalization\n+\n+This is the process of organizing a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity.\n+\n+Its benefits include:\n+\n+- Minimizing duplicated data, which saves storage and reduces inconsistencies.\n+- Enforcing data integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys.\n+- Making databases easier to maintain and understand.\n+\n+### Normal Forms\n+\n+- **1NF (First Normal Form)**\n+  - Each cell contains a single (atomic) value.\n+  - Each record is unique (enforced by a primary key).\n+  - Order of rows/columns is irrelevant.\n+  - Example: Move multiple phone numbers from a `students` table into a separate `student_phones` table.\n+\n+- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**\n+  - Meets 1NF requirements.\n+  - No **partial dependencies**: every non-key attribute must depend on the entire composite primary key.\n+  - Example: Split `orders` table into `order_header` and `order_items` to avoid attributes depending on only part of the key.\n+\n+- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**\n+  - Meets 2NF requirements.\n+  - No **transitive dependencies**: non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes.\n+  - Example: Move `city_postal_code` to a `cities` table instead of storing it with every order.\n+\n+- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**\n+  - Meets 3NF requirements.\n+  - Every determinant (left-hand side of a functional dependency) must be a superkey.\n+\n+**Tip**: Aim for 3NF in most designs for a good balance of integrity and performance.\n+\n+## Key SQL Concepts\n+\n+- SQL is a Structured Query Language for communicating with relational databases.\n+- **Basic commands** → `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, etc.\n+- `Joins` → Combines data from multiple tables (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`).\n+\n+## Running SQL Commands in Bash\n+\n+You can run SQL commands directly from the command line using the `psql` command-line client for PostgreSQL or similar tools for other databases.\n+\n+For example, to run a SQL file in PostgreSQL:\n+\n+```bash\n+psql -U username -d database_name -c \"SELECT * FROM students;\"\n+```\n+\n+You can also execute MySQL commands directly:\n+\n+```bash\n+mysql -u username -p database_name -e \"SELECT * FROM students;\"\n+```\n+\n+### Run SQL from a File\n+\n+```bash\n+# PostgreSQL\n+psql -U username -d database_name -f script.sql\n+\n+# MySQL\n+mysql -u username -p database_name < script.sql\n+```\n+\n+### Embed SQL in a Bash Script\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Insert student data\n+psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -c \\\n+\"INSERT INTO students (name, age, major) VALUES ('Alice', 20, 'CS');\"\n+```\n+\n+### Use of Variables in SQL\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+STUDENT_NAME=\"Bob\"\n+AGE=21\n+\n+psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -c \\\n+\"INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('$STUDENT_NAME', $AGE);\"\n+```\n+\n+**Tip**: Sanitize variables to avoid SQL injection.\n+\n+## Retrieving and Using SQL Query Results in Bash\n+\n+When you run SQL queries via `psql`, you can **capture** and **process** the returned values in your Bash scripts.\n+\n+### Capturing a Single Value\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Get total student count\n+STUDENT_COUNT=$(psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -t -A -c \\\n+\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;\")\n+\n+echo \"Total students: $STUDENT_COUNT\"\n+```\n+\n+Output → 42\n+\n+### Retrieving Multiple Columns\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Get top 3 students' names and ages\n+RESULTS=$(psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -t -A -F\",\" -c \\\n+\"SELECT name, age FROM students LIMIT 3;\")\n+\n+echo \"Top 3 students:\"\n+echo \"$RESULTS\"\n+```\n+\n+Output\n+\n+```bash\n+Alice,20\n+Bob,21\n+Charlie,22\n+```\n+\n+### Looping Through Query Results\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Get student names and majors\n+psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -t -A -F\",\" -c \\\n+\"SELECT name, major FROM students;\" | while IFS=\",\" read -r name major\n+do\n+    echo \"Student: $name | Major: $major\"\n+done\n+```\n+\n+Shape of Output\n+\n+```bash\n+Student: Alice | Major: CS\n+Student: Bob   | Major: Math\n+Student: Carol | Major: Physics\n+```\n+\n+## SQL Injection\n+\n+It is a web security vulnerability where attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the database.\n+\n+This can lead to risky actions like:\n+\n+- Bypassing authentication.\n+- Stealing sensitive data.\n+- Modifying or deleting records.\n+\n+An example of an SQL injection attack:\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ' \" \" OR \"1\"=\"1\" -- ' AND password = 'anything';\n+```\n+\n+This query would return all users because the condition `OR \"1\"=\"1\"` is always true, allowing attackers to bypass login checks.\n+\n+### Preventing SQL Injection\n+\n+1. **Use Prepared Statements**: These separate SQL code from data, preventing injection. Here's an example (Node.js with pg):\n+\n+    ```sql\n+    client.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1 AND password = $2', [username, password]);\n+    ```\n+\n+2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats.\n+\n+3. **Least Privilege**: Use database accounts with the minimum permissions necessary for the application.\n+\n+**Note**: Never grant admin rights to application accounts.\n+\n+## N+1 Problem\n+\n+The N+1 problem occurs when an application makes one query to retrieve a list of items (N) and then makes an additional query for each item to retrieve related data, resulting in N+1 queries.\n+\n+**Why It's Bad**\n+\n+- Each query adds network and processing overhead.\n+- Multiple small queries are slower than one optimized query.\n+\n+### Example of N+1 Pattern\n+\n+```sql\n+-- 1: Get list of orders\n+SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 50;\n+\n+-- N: For each order, get customer\n+SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = ...;\n+```\n+\n+**Solution**: Use `JOINs` or other set-based operations.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT \n+  orders.order_id,\n+  orders.product,\n+  orders.quantity,\n+  customers.customer_id,\n+  customers.name,\n+  customers.email,\n+  customers.address\n+FROM orders\n+JOIN customers \n+  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id\n+WHERE orders.order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders LIMIT 50);\n+```\n+\n+Always look for opportunities to combine related data into a single query.\n+\n+## Introduction to Version Control \n+\n+- **Definition**: A version control system allows you to track and manage changes in your project. Examples of version control systems used in software are Git, SVN, or Mercurial.\n+\n+## Cloud-Based Version Control Providers\n+\n+- **List of Cloud-Based Version Control Providers**: GitHub and GitLab are popular examples of cloud-based version control providers that allow software teams to collaborate and manage repositories. \n+\n+## Installing and Setting up Git\n+\n+- **Installing Git**: To check if Git is already installed on your machine you can run the following command in the terminal:\n+\n+```sh\n+git --version\n+```\n+\n+If you see a version number, that means Git is installed. If not, then you will need to install it.\n+\n+For Linux systems, Git often comes preinstalled with most distros. If you do not have Git pre-installed, you should be able to install it with your package manager commands such as `sudo apt-get install git` or `sudo pacman -S git`.\n+\n+For Mac users, you can install Git via Homebrew with `brew install git`, or you can download the executable installer from Git's website.\n+\n+For Windows, you can download the executable installer from Git's website. Or, if you have set up Chocolatey, you can run `choco install git.install` in PowerShell. Note that on Windows, you may also want to download Git Bash so you have a Unix-like shell environment available.\n+\n+To make sure the installation worked, run the `git --version` command again in the terminal.\n+\n+- **Git Configurations**: `git config` is used to set configuration variables that are responsible for how Git operates on your machine. To view your current setting variables and where they are stored on your system, you can run the following command:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --list --show-origin\n+```\n+\n+Right now you should be seeing only system-level configuration settings if you just installed Git for the first time. \n+\n+To set your user name, you can run the following command:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\"\n+```\n+\n+The `--global` flag is used here to set the user name for all projects on your system that use Git. If you need to override the user name for a particular project, then you can run the command in that particular project directory without the `--global` flag.\n+\n+To set the user email address, you can run the following command:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com\n+```\n+\n+Another configuration you can set is the preferred editor you want Git to use. Here is an example of how to set your preferred editor to Emacs:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --global core.editor emacs\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to set a preferred editor, then Git will default to your system's default editor.\n+\n+## Open vs. Closed Source Software\n+\n+- **Definition**: \"Open-source\" means people can see the code you publish, propose changes, report issues, and even run a modified version. \"Closed-source\" means the only people who can see and interact with the project are the people you explicitly authorize.\n+\n+## GitHub \n+\n+- **Definition**: GitHub is a cloud-based solution that offers storage of version-controlled projects in something called \"repositories\", and enables collaboration features to use with those projects.\n+- **GitHub CLI**: This tool is used to do GitHub-specific tasks without leaving the command line. If you do not have it installed, you can get instructions to do so from GitHub's documentation - but you should have it available in your system's package manager.\n+- **GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages is an option for deploying static sites, or applications that do not require a back-end server to handle logic. That is, applications that run entirely client-side, or in the user's browser, can be fully deployed on this platform.\n+- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions is a feature that lets you automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository including building, testing, and deploying your code.\n+\n+## Common Git Commands\n+\n+- **`git init`**: This will initialize an empty Git repository so Git can begin tracking changes for this project. When you initialize an empty Git repository to a project, a new `.git` hidden directory will be added. This `.git` directory contains important information for Git to manage your project. \n+- **`git status`**: This command is used to show the current state of your working directory - you will be using this command a lot in your workflow.\n+- **`git add`**: This command is used to stage your changes. Anything in the staging area will be added for the next commit. If you want to stage all unstaged changes, then you can use `git add .` The period (`.`) is an alias for the current directory you are in. \n+- **`git commit`**: This command is used to commit your changes. A commit is a snapshot of your project state at that given time. If you run `git commit`, it will open up your preferred editor you set in the Git configuration. Once the editor is open, you can provide a detailed message of your changes. You can also choose to provide a shorter message by using the `git commit -m` command like this:\n+\n+```sh\n+git commit -m \"short message goes here\"\n+```\n+\n+- **`git log`**: This will list all prior commits with helpful information like the author, date of commit, commit message and commit hash. The commit hash is a long string which serves as a unique identifier for a commit.\n+- **`git remote add`**: This command is used to setup the remote connection to your remote repo.\n+- **`git push`**: This command is used to push up your changes to a remote repository.\n+- **`git pull`**: This command is used to pull down the latest changes from your remote repository into your local repository.  \n+- **`git clone`**: This command will clone a repository. This means you will have a copy of the repository. This copy includes the repository history, all files/folders and commits on your local device.\n+- **`git remote -v`**: This command will show the list of remote repositories associated with your local Git repository.\n+- **`git branch`**: This command will list all of your local branches.\n+- **`git fetch upstream`**: This command tells Git to go get the latest changes that are on your upstream remote (which is the original repo).\n+- **`git merge upstream/main`**: This command tells Git to merge the latest changes from the `main` branch in the upstream remote into your current branch.\n+- **`git reset`**: This command allows you to reset the current state of a branch. Passing the `--hard` flag tells Git to force the local files to match the branch state. This ensures that you have a clean slate to work from. \n+- **`git rebase`**: A rebase in Git is a way to move or combine a sequence of commits from one branch onto another. \n+  \n+## Working with Branches\n+\n+- **Definition**: A branch in Git is a separate workspace where you can make changes. The `main` branch will often represent the primary or production branch in a real world application. Developer teams will create multiple branches for new features and bug fixes and then merge those changes back into the `main` branch. \n+- **Creating a New Branch**: To create a new branch you can run the following command:\n+\n+```sh\n+git branch feature\n+```\n+\n+To checkout that branch, you can run the following command:\n+\n+```sh\n+git checkout feature\n+```\n+\n+Most developers will use the shorthand command for creating and checking out a branch which is the following:\n+\n+```sh\n+git checkout -b new-branch-name\n+```\n+\n+A newer and alternative command would be the `git switch` command. Here is an example for creating and switching to a new branch:\n+\n+```sh\n+git switch -c new-branch-name\n+```\n+\n+- **Branching Strategies**: Your `main` branch is your default branch and usually is pretty stable. So it is best to branch off from there to create new branches for items like bug fixes, new features, or other miscellaneous work. \n+- **Merge Conflicts**: This happens when Git tries to automatically merge changes from different branches but can't decide which changes to keep. This usually happens when there are conflicting changes for the same portion of the file. \n+\n+## Five States for a Git Tracked File\n+\n+- **\"Untracked\"**: This means that the file is new to the repository, and Git has not \"seen\" it before.\n+- **\"Modified\"**: This file existed in the previous commit, and has changes that have not been committed.\n+- **\"Ignored\"**: You likely won't see ignored files in Git, but your IDE might have an indicator for them. Ignored files are excluded from Git operations, typically because they are included in the `.gitignore` file.\n+- **\"Deleted\"**: A deleted file is the opposite of an untracked file - it's a file that previously existed, and has been removed.\n+- **\"Renamed\"**: A renamed file is a file where the contents are unchanged, but the name or location of the file was modified. In some cases, a file can be considered renamed even if it has a small amount of changes.\n+\n+## `.gitignore` Files\n+\n+- **Definition**: The `.gitignore` file is a special type of file related to Git operations. The name suggests that this file is used to tell Git to ignore things, and that's the common use case. But what it actually does is it tells Git to stop tracking a file.\n+\n+## Working with Repositories \n+\n+- **Definition**: A repository is like a container for a project - if you are working on an app, you would keep the files for that app together in a repository. Repositories can be local on your computer, or remote on a service like GitHub. \n+- **Public vs. Private Repositories**: A public repository can be viewed and downloaded by anyone. A private repository can only be accessed by you, and anyone you grant explicit access to.\n+- **Creating Repositories on GitHub**: To create a new repository on GitHub, you can click on the `\"New Repository\"` button and walk through the GitHub UI of setting up a new repository.\n+- **Pushing Local Repositories to GitHub**: If you have a local project on your computer, you can push up that repository to GitHub. Here is a step-by-step overview of the process:\n+\n+1. Initialize an empty git repository in the project directory (`git init`).\n+2. Make changes to your project.\n+3. Run the `git status` command to see all changes made that are being tracked by git.\n+4. Stage your changes (`git add`).\n+5. Commit your changes (`git commit`).\n+6. Setup the remote connection (`git remote add`).\n+7. Push your changes to GitHub (`git push`).\n+\n+## Pull Requests\n+\n+- **Pull Requests**: A pull request is a request to pull changes in from your branch into the target branch. Pull requests are the flow you use when you want to contribute code changes to a project. This approach allows the maintainers of the project to review your changes. They can leave comments, ask questions, and suggest tweaks. Then once the review process is complete, it can be approved and merged into the main branch.\n+\n+## Contributing to Other Repositories\n+\n+- **Process**: There are thousands of projects that you can contribute to. Here is the basic process on how to contribute to another repository:\n+\n+1. Read the contributing documentation\n+2. Find an available issue to work on\n+3. Fork the repository\n+4. Clone your forked copy of the repository\n+5. Create a new branch\n+6. Make the changes according to the issue\n+7. Create a PR (Pull Request)\n+8. Wait for a review for that PR\n+\n+## Working with SSH and GPG Keys \n+\n+- **GPG Keys**: GPG, or Gnu Privacy Guard, keys are typically used to sign files or commits. Someone can then use your public GPG key to verify that the file signature is from your key and that the contents of the file have not been modified or tampered with. \n+\n+To generate a GPG key, you'll need to run:\n+\n+```sh\n+gpg --full-generate-key\n+```\n+\n+- **SSH Keys**: SSH, or Secure SHell, keys are typically used to authenticate a remote connection to a server - via the `ssh` utility. You can also use an SSH key to sign commits.\n+\n+For an SSH key, you'll run:\n+\n+```sh\n+ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n+```\n+\n+`ed25519` is a modern public-key signature algorithm.\n+\n+- **Signing Commits with GPG Keys**: In order to sign your commits with your GPG key, you'll need to upload your public key, not the private key, to your GitHub account. To list your public keys, you will need to run the following: \n+\n+```sh\n+gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long\n+```\n+\n+Then, to get the public key, use:\n+\n+```sh\n+gpg --armor --export \"<key id>\"\n+```\n+  \n+Then, take the short ID you got from listing the keys and run this command to set it as your git signing key:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --global user.signingkey <your_gpg_key_id>\n+```\n+\n+Then, you can pass the `-S` flag to your `git commit` command to sign a specific commit - you'll need to provide your passphrase. Alternatively, if you want to sign every commit automatically, you can set the autosign config to `true`:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --global commit.gpgsign true\n+```\n+\n+- **Signing Commits with SSH Keys**: To sign with an SSH key, which is a relatively new feature on GitHub, you'll need to start by uploading the key to your GitHub account. Then you'll need to set the signing mode for git to use SSH:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --global gpg.format ssh\n+```\n+\n+Then, to set the signing key, you'll pass the file path instead of an ID:\n+\n+```sh\n+git config --global user.signingkey <path_to_your_ssh_keys>\n+```\n \n # --assignment--\n \n-Review the Relational Databases topics and concepts.\n+Review Bash, SQL and other Relational Database topics and concepts."
