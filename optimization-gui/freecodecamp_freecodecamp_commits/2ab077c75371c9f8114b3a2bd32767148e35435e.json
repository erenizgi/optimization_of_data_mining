If the first element is greater than the second one, it swaps them. Then, it proceeds with the following couple. When the sequence ends, it starts a new cycle from the beginning of the sequence, and repeats the process until the elements are sorted.\n+The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts a sequence of integers by comparing couples of adjacent elements starting from the beginning of the sequence. If the first element is greater than the second one, it swaps them. Then, it proceeds with the following couple. When the last element of the sequence is reached, it starts a new cycle from the beginning of the sequence, and repeats the process until the elements are sorted. The algorithm stops after one cycle completes with no swaps.\n \n For this lab, you have been provided with all the HTML and CSS. You will use JavaScript to complete the Bubble Sort Visualizer so that it visualizes each step needed by the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of five integers.\n "
