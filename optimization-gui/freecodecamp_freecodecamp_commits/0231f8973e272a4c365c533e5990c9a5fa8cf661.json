Hexadecimal color values, or hex codes, are a concise way to represent colors in the RGB color model.

This is possible when both characters in each color pair are the same. For instance, `#FF5733` cannot be shortened, but `#FFFFFF` (white) can be written as `#FFF`.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<h2>This is a heading.</h2>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n+body {\n+  background-color: #000;\n+}\n+\n h2 {\n   color: #FFF; /* White in shorthand */\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The shorthand `#FFF` is equivalent to `#FFFFFF`.

They're ideal when you need specific branding colors, want to control exact shades that aren't easily defined by named colors or HSL, or when you're copying colors from design software that provides hex codes by default."
