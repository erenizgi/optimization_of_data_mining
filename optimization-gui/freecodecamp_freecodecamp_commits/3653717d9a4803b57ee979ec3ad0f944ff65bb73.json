One of the things that you might have been wondering about is how you can use properties like the `.length` property on string primitives.\n \n-When you use the `length` property on a string primitive, JavaScript temporarily wraps the string primitive in a string object, to perform the operation. This is why you can use the `length` property and the different methods like `repeat()`, `concat()`, and `slice()`. These types of methods and properties are referred to as instance methods also properties and static methods. You will learn about how that works in detail in future modules.\n+When you use the `length` property on a string primitive, JavaScript temporarily wraps the string primitive in a string object, to perform the operation.

String primitives are usually more memory efficient and faster compared to string objects. Although you will primarily work with string primitives in your code, it's still useful to understand how string objects work.\n "
