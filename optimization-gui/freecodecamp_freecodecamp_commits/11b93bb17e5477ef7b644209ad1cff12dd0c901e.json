It's particularly useful for adjusting the visual presentation of images, backgrounds and even text without modifying the original asset.\n \n@@ -19,62 +19,116 @@ selector {\n \n Here `function` represents the specific filter effect you want to apply, and `amount` is typically a value that determines the intensity of the effect. Now let's look at some common filter functions and their uses.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n img {\n-  filter: blur(5px);\n+  filter: blur(2px);\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The `blur` function applies a gaussian blur to the element, the amount is specified in pixels and represents the radius of the blur. This CSS rule will apply a 5 pixel blur to all images on the page. The `blur` effect can be useful for creating depth in your design or for obscuring parts of an image. \n \n The `brightness` function adjusts the brightness of the element. A value of `0%` will make the element completely black, while values over `100%` will increase the brightness. \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n-.bright-image {\n+img {\n   filter: brightness(150%);\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This CSS rule increases the brightness of elements with the class `bright-image` by `50%`. Brightness adjustments can be used to make images pop or create a washed-out effect.\n \n The `grayscale` function converts the element to grayscale. The amount is defined as a percentage, where `100%` is completely grayscale and `0%` leaves the image unchanged.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n-.gray-image {\n+img {\n   filter: grayscale(100%);\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This rule will convert elements with the class `gray-image` to complete grayscale. `grayscale` can be used to create a vintage look or de-emphasize certain elements on a page.\n \n The `sepia` function applies a sepia tone to the element. Like grayscale, it uses a percentage value: \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n-.old-photo {\n+img {\n   filter: sepia(80%);\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This rule applies an `80%` sepia effect to elements with the class `old-photo`. The sepia effect is great for creating a vintage or old-timey look.\n \n The `hue-rotate` function applies the hue rotation to the element. The value is defined in degrees, and represents a rotation around the color circle. \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n-.color-shift {\n+img {\n   filter: hue-rotate(90deg);\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This rule rotates the hue of elements with the class `color-shift` by `90` degrees. Hue rotation can be used to create psychedelic effects or to adjust the overall color scheme of an image.\n \n One of the most powerful aspects of the `filter` property is the ability to combine multiple effects. You can apply several filters to the same element by separating them with spaces: \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n-.multi-filter {  \n+img {  \n   filter: contrast(150%) brightness(110%) sepia(30%);  \n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This rule applies increased contrast, slightly increased brightness, and a subtle sepia effect to elements with the class `multi-filter`. \n \n By combining filters you can create complex and unique visual effects tailored to your design needs. The CSS filter property is a versatile tool that allows for creative visual manipulation of web elements. "
