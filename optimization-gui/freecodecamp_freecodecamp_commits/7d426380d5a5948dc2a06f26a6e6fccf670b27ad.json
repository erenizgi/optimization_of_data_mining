Understanding common error messages will help you debug more effectively and develop into a stronger programmer. The four common types of error messages are `SyntaxError`, `ReferenceError`, `TypeError`, and `RangeError`.\n \n A `SyntaxError` happens when you write something incorrectly in your code, like missing a parenthesis, or a bracket. Think of it like a grammar mistake in a sentence. Here is a common mistake developers make when creating arrays:"
