One of the things that you might have been wondering about is how you can use properties like the `.length` property on string primitives.\n \n When you use the `length` property on a string primitive, JavaScript temporarily wraps the string primitive in a string object, to perform the operation. This is why you can use the `length` property and the different methods like `repeat()`, `concat()`, and `slice()`. These types of methods and properties are referred to as instance methods also properties and static methods. You will learn about how that works in detail in future modules."
