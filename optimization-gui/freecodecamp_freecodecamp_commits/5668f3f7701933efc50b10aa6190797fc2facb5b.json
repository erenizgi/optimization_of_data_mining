It allows you to add or remove elements from any position in an array, including the middle. The return value for the `splice()` method will be an array of the items removed from the array. If nothing was removed, then an empty array will be returned.\n \n@@ -19,6 +19,8 @@ array.splice(startIndex, itemsToRemove, item1, item2)\n \n Let's start with an example of removing elements from the middle of an array:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"mango\", \"kiwi\"];\n let removed = fruits.splice(2, 2);\n@@ -27,26 +29,38 @@ console.log(fruits);  // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\"]\n console.log(removed); // [\"orange\", \"mango\"]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, `splice(2, 2)` starts at index `2` and removes `2` elements. The modified array will now consist of only `apple`, `banana`, and `kiwi`. Now, let's look at how to add elements to the middle of an array:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"];\n colors.splice(1, 0, \"yellow\", \"purple\");\n \n console.log(colors); // [\"red\", \"yellow\", \"purple\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, `splice(1, 0, \"yellow\", \"purple\")` starts at index `1`, removes `0` elements, and inserts `yellow` and `purple`. The second parameter (`0`) means no elements are removed before insertion. You can also use `splice()` to simultaneously remove and add elements:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n numbers.splice(1, 2, 6, 7, 8);\n \n console.log(numbers); // [1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 5]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this case, `splice(1, 2, 6, 7, 8)` starts at index `1`, removes `2` elements (`2` and `3`), and inserts `6`, `7`, and `8`. If you need to keep the original array unchanged, you should create a copy before using `splice()`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let original = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n let copy = [...original];\n@@ -56,12 +70,16 @@ console.log(original); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n console.log(copy);     // [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, to create a copy of the `original` array without modifying it, we use the spread operator (`...`). The spread operator will create a shallow copy of the elements of the `original` array into a new array.  You will learn more about this in future lessons.\n \n When we use `copy.splice(2, 1, 6)`, it modifies the copy array by removing the element at index `2` (which is `3`) and inserting the new element `6` at that position.\n \n One common use case for `splice()` is to remove a single element from an array when you know its index:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"mango\"];\n let indexToRemove = fruits.indexOf(\"orange\");\n@@ -72,19 +90,25 @@ if (indexToRemove !== -1) {\n console.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\"]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we first use the `indexOf()` method to find the index of the element `orange` in the `fruits` array. The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given element or `-1` if the element is not found in the array. \n \n We then compare `indexToRemove` with `-1` to ensure that the element exists in the array before attempting to remove it. If `indexToRemove` is not equal to `-1` (meaning the element is found), we use `splice()` to remove one element starting from the `indexToRemove` position.\n \n You can also use `splice()` to clear an array by removing all elements:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n array.splice(0);\n \n console.log(array); // []\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n While `splice()` is powerful, it's worth noting that for very large arrays, it can be less efficient than other methods, especially when modifying the beginning of the array. This is because `splice()` may need to shift all subsequent elements. In such cases, if you're only adding or removing elements at the end of the array, methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `unshift()`, and `shift()` might be more appropriate.\n \n In conclusion, the `splice()` method is a versatile way for modifying arrays in JavaScript. It allows for precise control over adding and removing elements from any position in an array. Understanding how to use `splice()` effectively can greatly enhance your ability to manipulate arrays in your JavaScript code."
