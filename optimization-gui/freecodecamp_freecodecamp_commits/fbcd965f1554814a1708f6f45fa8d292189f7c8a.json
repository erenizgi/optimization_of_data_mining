The details could also be definitions, or other information related to the terms.\n \n You will need three HTML elements to define a description list. First, the description list element, `dl`, which is the container for the entire list.

In this case the description list has two terms, HTML and CSS, so it has two of these elements.\n \n And finally, after each term you will find a description details element, `dd`, for the description, or details associated with that term. In this example, they are Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets.\n \n In the browser, you would see each term followed by its corresponding description. By default, the descriptions are slightly more indented towards the right to distinguish them visually.\n \n But description lists are not limited to only terms and definitions. They are much more versatile than that. Here we have a recipe with two ingredients.\n \n+Uncomment the code to see the new detail item show up in the preview window.\n+\n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```html\n <dl>\n   <dt>Flour</dt>\n   <dd>2 cups</dd>\n   <dt>Sugar</dt>\n   <dd>1/2 cup</dd>\n+  <!-- <dt>Vegetable Oil</dt>\n+  <dd>2 tablespoons</dd> -->\n </dl>\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The entire description list is within a description list element. The first ingredient, `Flour`, is within a description term element. Then, you can see how much of this ingredient you will need: `2 cups`. This is within a description details element directly after its corresponding ingredients.\n \n And the same structure is repeated for `Sugar`. In this case, the recipe has only two ingredients, but if there were more the same structure could be repeated throughout the description list."
