For example, when you visit a website, your browser sends a network request to the web server to get the files (such as HTML, images, or videos) needed to display the page.\n \n A service worker is a special type of JavaScript file that runs in the background of a web application, separate from the main browser thread. It acts as a middleman between the web page and the network, allowing developers to intercept network requests, cache resources, and handle things like push notifications or background sync.\n \n A PWA, or Progressive Web App, is a type of web application that uses modern web technologies to provide a native app-like experience on the web. PWAs are designed to work reliably on any device, regardless of network conditions, and can be accessed through a browser or installed on a user's device like a traditional app. \n \n Now that we have a better understanding of service workers, PWAs, and network requests, we can dive deeper into the Cache API.\n \n-The Cache API is a storage mechanism that stores `Request` and `Response` objects.
