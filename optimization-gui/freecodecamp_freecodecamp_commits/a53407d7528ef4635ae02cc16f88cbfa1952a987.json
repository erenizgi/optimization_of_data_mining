It has been part of the language since its inception and for many years it remained the primary method for creating variables. However as JavaScript evolved and developers gained more experience with the language, certain drawbacks of using `var` became apparent leading to the introduction of `let` and `const` in 2015.\n \n When you declare a variable with `var`, it becomes function-scoped or globally-scoped. This means that if you declare a variable inside a function using `var` it's only accessible within that function. However if you declare it outside any function, it becomes a global variable accessible throughout your entire script. This behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected results and make your code harder to understand.\n \n A problem with `var` is that it allows you to redeclare the same variable multiple times without throwing an error. This can lead to accidental overwrites and make debugging more difficult.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n var num = 5;\n+console.log(num); // 5\n \n // This is allowed and doesn't throw an error\n var num = 10;\n+console.log(num); // 10\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The most significant issue with `var` is its lack of block scoping. Variables declared with `var` inside a block like an `if` statement or a `for` loop are still accessible outside that block. \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n if (true) {\n   var num = 5;\n }\n console.log(num); // 5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This behavior can lead to unintended variable leaks and make your code more prone to bugs.\n \n Due to these issues, modern JavaScript development has largely moved away from `var` in favor of `let` and `const`. These keywords provide block scoping which aligns more closely with how scoping works in many other programming languages."
