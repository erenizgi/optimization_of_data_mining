By setting and configuring a Content Security Policy you can prevent the injection of anything unintended into your page. This will protect your app from XSS vulnerabilities, undesired tracking, malicious frames, and much more. CSP works by defining an allowed list of content sources which are trusted. You can configure them for each kind of resource a web page may need (scripts, stylesheets, fonts, frames, media, and so on...). There are multiple directives available, so a website owner can have a granular control. See HTML 5 Rocks, KeyCDN for more details. Unfortunately CSP is unsupported by older browsers.\n "

A hash is basically a fingerprint of the original data- always unique. This is accomplished by feeding the original data into an algorithm and returning a fixed length result. To further complicate this process and make it more secure, you can also *salt* your hash. Salting your hash involves adding random data to the original data before the hashing process which makes it even harder to crack the hash.\n "
