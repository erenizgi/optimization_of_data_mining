This property is a shorthand that allows you to set the width, style, and color of the border all at once.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n img {\n   border: 2px solid red;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This CSS rule adds a 2-pixel wide, solid red border around all `img` elements. You can adjust the width, style (such as `dashed`, `dotted`, or `double`), and color to suit your design needs.\n \n If you need more control over individual sides of the border, you can use the specific border properties for each side:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cat lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n img {\n-  border-top: 1px solid red;\n-  border-right: 2px dashed green;\n-  border-bottom: 3px dotted blue;\n-  border-left: 4px double yellow;\n+  border-top: 10px solid red;\n+  border-right: 10px dashed green;\n+  border-bottom: 10px dotted blue;\n+  border-left: 10px double purple;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This allows you to create unique border styles for each side of the image.\n \n Another way to create a border effect is by using the `outline` property. While similar to border, outline doesn't affect the element's dimensions or layout:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cate lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n img {\n   outline: 3px solid gold;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This creates a gold outline around the image without changing its size or position.\n \n If you want to create rounded corners on your border, you can use the `border-radius` property in conjunction with border:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+\n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cate lying on its back.\">\n+```\n+\n ```css\n img {\n   border: 2px solid black;\n   border-radius: 10px;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Remember, these techniques can be combined and customized to create unique border effects. The choice of method depends on your specific design requirements and the level of complexity you need.\n \n # --questions--"
