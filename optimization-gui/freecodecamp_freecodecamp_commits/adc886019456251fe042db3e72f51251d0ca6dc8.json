Instead, it first visits one of its neighbors and continues down that path until there are no more nodes to be visited on that path.\n+\n+To implement this algorithm, you'll want to use a stack (an array where the last element added is the first to be removed, following the <dfn>Last-In-First-Out</dfn> principle). A stack is helpful in depth-first search algorithms because, as you add neighbors to the stack, you want to visit the most recently added neighbors first and remove them from the stack.\n+\n+A simple output of this algorithm is a list of nodes which are reachable from a given node. Therefore, you'll also want to keep track of the nodes you visit.\n+\n+**Objective**: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.\n+\n+**User Stories:**\n+\n+1. You should have a function named `dfs`.\n+1. The `dfs` function should take two arguments:\n+   - An undirected, adjacency matrix.\n+   - A node label, which is the numeric value of the node between `0` and `n - 1`, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the graph.\n+1.
