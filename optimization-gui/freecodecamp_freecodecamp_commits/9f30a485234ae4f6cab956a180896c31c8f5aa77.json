This API allows you to assert that the user’s provided value for that element passes any HTML-level validation you have written, such as minimum length or pattern matching. \n+- **`checkValidity()` method**: This method returns `true` if the element matches all HTML validation (based on its attributes), and `false` if it fails.\n+\n+```js\n+const input = document.querySelector(\"input\");\n+\n+input.addEventListener(\"input\", (e) => {\n+  if (!e.target.checkValidity()) {\n+    e.target.setCustomValidity(\"You must use a .com email.\")\n+  }\n+})\n+```\n+\n+- **`reportValidity()` Method**: This method tells the browser that the `input` is invalid.\n+\n+```js\n+const input = document.querySelector(\"input\");\n+\n+input.addEventListener(\"input\", (e) => {\n+  if (!e.target.checkValidity()) {\n+    e.target.reportValidity();\n+  }\n+})\n+```\n+\n+- **`validity` Property**: This property is used to get or set the validity state of form controls (like `<input>`, `<select>`, etc.) and provides information about whether the user input meets the constraints defined for that element (e.g., `required` fields, pattern constraints, maximum length, etc.).\n+\n+```js\n+const input = document.querySelector(\"input\");\n+\n+input.addEventListener(\"input\", (e) => {\n+  console.log(e.target.validity);\n+})\n+```\n+\n+- **`patternMismatch` Property**: This will be `true` if the value doesn't match the specified regular expression pattern.\n+\n+## `preventDefault()` Method\n+\n+- **Definition**: Every event that triggers in the DOM has some sort of default behavior. The click event on a checkbox toggles the state of that checkbox, by default. Pressing the space bar on a focused button activates the button. The `preventDefault()` method on these `Event` objects stops that behavior from happening.\n+\n+```js\n+button.addEventListener('click',(event) => {\n+  // Prevent the default button click behavior  \n+  event.preventDefault(); \n+  alert('Button click prevented!');\n+});\n+```\n+\n+## Submitting Forms\n+\n+- **Definition**: There are three ways a form can be submitted. The first is when the user clicks a button in the form which has the `type` attribute set to `submit`. The second is when the user presses the `Enter` key on any editable `input` field in the form. The third is through a JavaScript call to the `requestSubmit()` or `submit()` methods of the `form` element.\n+- **`action` Attribute**: The `action` attribute should contain either a URL or a relative path for the current domain. This value determines where the form attempts to send data - if you do not set an `action` attribute, the form will send data to the current page’s URL. \n+\n+```js\n+<form action=\"https://freecodecamp.org\">\n+  <input\n+    type=\"text\"\n+    id=\"input\"\n+    placeholder=\"Enter a number\"\n+    name=\"number\"\n+  />\n+  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n+</form>\n+```\n+\n+- **`method` Attribute**: This attribute accepts a standard `HTTP` method, such as `GET` or `POST`, and uses that method when making the request to the action URL. When a method is not set, the form will default to a `GET` request. The data in the form will be URL encoded as `name=value` pairs and appended to the action URL as query parameters.\n+\n+```js\n+<form action=\"/data\" method=\"POST\">\n+  <input\n+    type=\"text\"\n+    id=\"input\"\n+    placeholder=\"Enter a number\"\n+    name=\"number\"\n+  />\n+  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n+</form>\n+```\n+\n+- **`enctype` Attribute**: The `form` element accepts an `enctype` attribute, which represents the encoding type to use for the data. This attribute only accepts three values: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (which is the default, sending the data as a URL-encoded form body), `text/plain` (which sends the data in plaintext form, in `name=value` pairs separated by new lines), or `mulitpart/form-data`, which is specifically for handling forms with a file upload.\n \n \n # --assignment--"
