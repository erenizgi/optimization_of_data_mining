It's the default value of uninitialized variables and function parameters that weren't provided an argument. `undefined` converts to `NaN` in numeric contexts, which makes all numeric comparisons with `undefined` return `false`.\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(undefined > 0);  // false\n+console.log(undefined < 0);  // false\n+console.log(undefined == 0); // false\n+```\n+\n+- **Comparisons and `null`**: The `null` type represents the intentional absence of a value. When using the equality operator, `null` and `undefined` are considered equal. However, when using the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks both value and type without performing type coercion, `null` and `undefined` are not equal:\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(null == undefined); // true\n+console.log(null === undefined); // false\n+```\n+\n+## `switch` Statements\n+\n+- **Definition**: A `switch` statement evaluates an expression and matches its value against a series of `case` clauses. When a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed. \n+\n+```js\n+const dayOfWeek = 3; \n+\n+switch (dayOfWeek) {\n+  case 1:\n+    console.log(\"It's Monday!
