Each cell contains a single (atomic) value.\n+  - Each record is unique (enforced by a primary key).\n+  - Order of rows/columns is irrelevant.\n+  - Example: Move multiple phone numbers from a `students` table into a separate `student_phones` table.\n+\n+- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**\n+  - Meets 1NF requirements.\n+  - No **partial dependencies**: every non-key attribute must depend on the entire composite primary key.\n+  - Example: Split `orders` table into `order_header` and `order_items` to avoid attributes depending on only part of the key.\n+\n+- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**\n+  - Meets 2NF requirements.\n+  - No **transitive dependencies**: non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes.\n+  - Example: Move `city_postal_code` to a `cities` table instead of storing it with every order.\n+\n+- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**\n+  - Meets 3NF requirements.\n+  - Every determinant (left-hand side of a functional dependency) must be a superkey.\n+\n+**Tip**: Aim for 3NF in most designs for a good balance of integrity and performance.\n+\n+## Key SQL Concepts\n+\n+- SQL is a Structured Query Language for communicating with relational databases.\n+- **Basic commands** → `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, etc.\n+- `Joins` → Combines data from multiple tables (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`).\n+\n+## Running SQL Commands in Bash\n+\n+You can run SQL commands directly from the command line using the `psql` command-line client for PostgreSQL or similar tools for other databases.\n+\n+For example, to run a SQL file in PostgreSQL:\n+\n+```bash\n+psql -U username -d database_name -c \"SELECT * FROM students;\"\n+```\n+\n+You can also execute MySQL commands directly:\n+\n+```bash\n+mysql -u username -p database_name -e \"SELECT * FROM students;\"\n+```\n+\n+### Run SQL from a File\n+\n+```bash\n+# PostgreSQL\n+psql -U username -d database_name -f script.sql\n+\n+# MySQL\n+mysql -u username -p database_name < script.sql\n+```\n+\n+### Embed SQL in a Bash Script\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Insert student data\n+psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -c \\\n+\"INSERT INTO students (name, age, major) VALUES ('Alice', 20, 'CS');\"\n+```\n+\n+### Use of Variables in SQL\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+STUDENT_NAME=\"Bob\"\n+AGE=21\n+\n+psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -c \\\n+\"INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('$STUDENT_NAME', $AGE);\"\n+```\n+\n+**Tip**: Sanitize variables to avoid SQL injection.\n+\n+## Retrieving and Using SQL Query Results in Bash\n+\n+When you run SQL queries via `psql`, you can **capture** and **process** the returned values in your Bash scripts.\n+\n+### Capturing a Single Value\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Get total student count\n+STUDENT_COUNT=$(psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -t -A -c \\\n+\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;\")\n+\n+echo \"Total students: $STUDENT_COUNT\"\n+```\n+\n+Output → 42\n+\n+### Retrieving Multiple Columns\n \n-Review the Bash and SQL topics and concepts.\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Get top 3 students' names and ages\n+RESULTS=$(psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -t -A -F\",\" -c \\\n+\"SELECT name, age FROM students LIMIT 3;\")\n+\n+echo \"Top 3 students:\"\n+echo \"$RESULTS\"\n+```\n+\n+Output\n+\n+```bash\n+Alice,20\n+Bob,21\n+Charlie,22\n+```\n+\n+### Looping Through Query Results\n+\n+```bash\n+#!/bin/bash\n+DB_USER=\"school_admin\"\n+DB_NAME=\"school\"\n+\n+# Get student names and majors\n+psql -U \"$DB_USER\" -d \"$DB_NAME\" -t -A -F\",\" -c \\\n+\"SELECT name, major FROM students;\" | while IFS=\",\" read -r name major\n+do\n+    echo \"Student: $name | Major: $major\"\n+done\n+```\n+\n+Shape of Output\n+\n+```bash\n+Student: Alice | Major: CS\n+Student: Bob   | Major: Math\n+Student: Carol | Major: Physics\n+```\n+\n+## SQL Injection\n+\n+It is a web security vulnerability where attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the database.\n+\n+This can lead to risky actions like:\n+\n+- Bypassing authentication.\n+- Stealing sensitive data.\n+- Modifying or deleting records.\n+\n+An example of an SQL injection attack:\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ' \" \" OR \"1\"=\"1\" -- ' AND password = 'anything';\n+```\n+\n+This query would return all users because the condition `OR \"1\"=\"1\"` is always true, allowing attackers to bypass login checks.\n+\n+### Preventing SQL Injection\n+\n+1. **Use Prepared Statements**: These separate SQL code from data, preventing injection. Here's an example (Node.js with pg):\n+\n+    ```sql\n+    client.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1 AND password = $2', [username, password]);\n+    ```\n+\n+2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats.\n+\n+3. **Least Privilege**: Use database accounts with the minimum permissions necessary for the application.\n+\n+**Note**: Never grant admin rights to application accounts.\n+\n+## N+1 Problem\n+\n+The N+1 problem occurs when an application makes one query to retrieve a list of items (N) and then makes an additional query for each item to retrieve related data, resulting in N+1 queries.\n+\n+**Why It’s Bad**\n+\n+- Each query adds network and processing overhead.\n+- Multiple small queries are slower than one optimized query.\n+\n+### Example of N+1 Pattern\n+\n+```sql\n+-- 1: Get list of orders\n+SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 50;\n+\n+-- N: For each order, get customer\n+SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = ...;\n+```\n+\n+**Solution**: Use `JOINs` or other set-based operations.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT \n+  orders.order_id,\n+  orders.product,\n+  orders.quantity,\n+  customers.customer_id,\n+  customers.name,\n+  customers.email,\n+  customers.address\n+FROM orders\n+JOIN customers \n+  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id\n+WHERE orders.order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders LIMIT 50);\n+```\n+\n+Always look for opportunities to combine related data into a single query.\n+\n+# --assignment--"
