But, as a frontend developer, you should still be familiar with them. Tables are one of the earliest ways devs had for displaying data in a browser way back in the 1990s.\n+\n+Here's an example of code used to generate a table from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:\n+\n+```html\n+<table id=\"quickfacts\">\n+  <thead>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th colspan=\"2\">Quick Facts: Software Developers, Quality Assurance Analysts, and Testers</th>\n+    </tr>\n+  </thead>\n+  <tbody>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>2023 Median Pay</th>\n+      <td>\n+        $130,160 per year\n+        <br>$62.58 per hour\n+      </td>\n+    </tr>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>Typical Entry-Level Education</th>\n+      <td>Bachelor's degree</td>\n+    </tr>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>Work Experience in a Related Occupation</th>\n+      <td>None</td>\n+    </tr>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>On-the-job Training</th>\n+      <td>None</td>\n+    </tr>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>Number of Jobs, 2022</th>\n+      <td>1,795,300</td>\n+    </tr>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>Job Outlook, 2022-32</th>\n+      <td>25% (Much faster than average)</td>\n+    </tr>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>Employment Change, 2022-32</th>\n+      <td>451,200</td>\n+    </tr>\n+  </tbody>\n+  <tfoot>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>If this table had a footer it would be here.</th>\n+    </tr>\n+  </tfoot>\n+</table>\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, there's a main `table` element with an `id` set to `quickfacts`. Inside it, the table has a table head element, `thead`, table body element, `tbody`, and a table foot element, `tfoot`.\n+\n+The table head, body, and foot elements can each contain some number of table rows, `tr`. And each table row can contain a table header `th` which labels the data in that row. It can also contain some number of individual data cells, called table data, `td`.\n+\n+Now, that's a lot of HTML elements. But don't be intimidated – these follow a simple hierarchy.\n+\n+Here's the simplest table we can create that includes all of these elements:\n+\n+```html\n+<table>\n+  <thead>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>The title of this table</th>\n+    </tr>\n+  </thead>\n+  <tbody>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>First Row</th>\n+      <td>\n+        First Data Cell\n+      </td>\n+    </tr>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>Second Row</th>\n+      <td>\n+        Second Data Cell\n+      </td>\n+    </tr>\n+  </tbody>\n+  <tfoot>\n+    <tr>\n+      <th>The footer of this table, which might contain date of publication, author credits, or other meta information.</th>\n+    </tr>\n+  </tfoot>\n+</table>\n+```\n+\n+So as you can see, the data itself is always within a `tr` – and within that `tr` element is a `th` element with a header, and a `td` element with data.\n+\n+Some websites will choose to use `div`s to build their own tables instead of using the more appropriate `table` element.\n+\n+While it is possible to display tabular data using generic `div` elements, it is still better to use the `table` element instead.\n+\n+Many years ago, developers might have used a `table` to position non-data elements on a webpage. This was never considered a best practice. But you may encounter some codebases where tables are still used like this.\n+\n+Nowadays, developers use CSS flexbox and grid to layout their designs. freeCodeCamp will cover these tools in depth later.\n+\n+For now, just use HTML tables for their original intended purpose: displaying tabular data.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"
