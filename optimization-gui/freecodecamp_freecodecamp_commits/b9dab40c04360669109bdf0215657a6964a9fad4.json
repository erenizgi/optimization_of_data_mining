To determine if a person is overweight, first calculate their BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. If that value is > 25 then the person is overweight. Use the value `0` for NOT overweight and the value `1` for overweight.\n-- Normalize the data by making `0` always good and `1` always bad. If the value of `cholesterol` or `gluc` is `1`, make the value `0`. If the value is more than `1`, make the value `1`.\n-- Convert the data into long format and create a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features using `seaborn`'s `catplot()`. The dataset should be split by `Cardio` so there is one chart for each `cardio` value. The chart should look like `examples/Figure_1.png`.\n-- Clean the data. Filter out the following patient segments that represent incorrect data:\n-  - diastolic pressure is higher than systolic (Keep the correct data with `(df['ap_lo'] <= df['ap_hi'])`)\n-  - height is less than the 2.5th percentile (Keep the correct data with `(df['height'] >= df['height'].quantile(0.025))`)\n-  - height is more than the 97.5th percentile\n-  - weight is less than the 2.5th percentile\n-  - weight is more than the 97.5th percentile\n-- Create a correlation matrix using the dataset. Plot the correlation matrix using `seaborn`'s `heatmap()`. Mask the upper triangle. The chart should look like `examples/Figure_2.png`.\n-\n-Any time a variable is set to `None`, make sure to set it to the correct code.\n-\n-Unit tests are written for you under `test_module.py`.\n \n ## Instructions\n By each number in the `medical_data_visualizer.py` file, add the code from the associated instruction number below.\n@@ -76,6 +56,7 @@ By each number in the `medical_data_visualizer.py` file, add the code from the a\n 9.
