Any JSX you place between a component's opening and closing tags is passed to the component as `children`.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+```jsx\n+function Card({ children }) {\n+  return <div className=\"card\">{children}</div>;\n+}\n+\n+function App() {\n+  return (\n+    <Card>\n+      <h2>Hello</h2>\n+    </Card>\n+  );\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this case, the JSX inside `<Card>...</Card>` becomes the `children` prop. The rendered output in the DOM will be:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"card\">\n+  <h2>Hello</h2>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+This pattern is often used for component composition, where a component wraps other UI elements.\n+\n Sometimes, you can have a lot of properties that you have to pass as props. Instead of passing them one by one, you can use the spread operator (`...`), after converting them to an object. \n \n Here is an example of a new child component called `DeveloperCard`:"
