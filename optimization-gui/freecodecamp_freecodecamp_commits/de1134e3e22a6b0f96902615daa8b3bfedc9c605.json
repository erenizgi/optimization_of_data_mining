To do that, you must follow three simple rules:\n+\n+- You can move only top-most disks.\n+- You can move only one disk at a time.\n+- You cannot place larger disks on top of smaller ones.\n+\n+Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.\n+\n+**User Stories:**\n+\n+1. You should have a function named `hanoi_solver` that takes an integer representing the total number of disks of the puzzle as the argument.\n+1. The `hanoi_solver` function should solve the puzzle following the given rules in 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 moves, where `n` is the total number of disks.\n+1. The `hanoi_solver` function should return a string with all the moves taken to solve the puzzle, including the starting arrangement, with each move on a new line. Rods should be represented as lists of integers, (the smallest disk is represented by the number `1`) with each rod separated by a space.
