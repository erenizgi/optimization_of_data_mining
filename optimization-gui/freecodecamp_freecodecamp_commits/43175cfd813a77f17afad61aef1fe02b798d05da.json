Define a function called `isLeapYear` that takes a number as an argument.\n 2. Outside the function, declare a variable `year` that stores the value of the year you want to check.\n-3. Inside the function, use an `if/ else` statement or a ternary operator to check if the year is a leap year. \n-4. To check if the year is a leap year, fulfill the following conditions: \n+3. Inside the function, use an `if/ else` statement or a ternary operator to check if the year is a leap year.\n+4. To check if the year is a leap year, fulfill the following conditions:\n \n    - If the year is divisible by `4`, then it is a leap year.\n-   - If the year is divisible by `100`, then it is not a leap year.\n-   - If the year is divisible by `400`, then it is a leap year.\n+   - Unless the year is also divisible by `100`, then it is not a leap year.\n+   - Unless the year is also divisible by `400`, then it is a leap year.\n \n 5. If the year is a leap year, return `[year] is a leap year.`. Otherwise, return `[year] is not a leap year.`. You will replace `[year]` with the parameter defined in the `isLeapYear` function.\n 6. You should call the `isLeapYear` function with `year` as the argument and assign the result to a variable named `result`."
