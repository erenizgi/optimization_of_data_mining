Strings are one of the primitive data types in the language, along with numbers, booleans, `null`, and `undefined`.\n \n To create a string in JavaScript, you can use single quotes (`'`), or double quotes (`\"`).\n \n Here is an example of creating two variables that hold string values:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let singleQuotes = 'This is a string';\n+console.log(singleQuotes);\n let doubleQuotes = \"This is also a string\";\n+console.log(doubleQuotes);\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Even though you can use single or double quotes to create strings, it's important to be consistent. If a string begins with a single quote, it must also end with a single quote.\n \n The same applies to double quotes. The following example will throw an error because it starts with a double quote and ends with a single quote:\n@@ -30,11 +36,17 @@ Another thing to take into account is that strings are immutable.
