This method returns a boolean value: `true` if the array contains the specified element, and `false` otherwise. \n \n The `includes()` method is particularly useful when you need to quickly verify the presence of an element in an array without needing to know its exact position. Let's start with an example of how to use the `includes()` method:"

Creating shallow copies of arrays is a common operation, especially when you want to manipulate an array without modifying the original. \n \n There are several methods for creating shallow copies of arrays, and we'll explore some of the most common ones: `concat()`, `slice()`, and the spread operator."
