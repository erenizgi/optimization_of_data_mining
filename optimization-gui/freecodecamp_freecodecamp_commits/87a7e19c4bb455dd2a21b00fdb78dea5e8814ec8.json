This library is flexible and works naturally with the web. Instead of having to learn a whole new graphical representation, you can build data visualizations with `svg` and `canvas` elements.\n+\n+For example, if you want to create a bar chart using D3, you can do the following all in one JS file:\n+\n+* Declare variables representing the chart dimensions and margins\n+    \n+* Declare the horizontal position scale\n+    \n+* Declare the vertical position scale\n+    \n+* Create the SVG container with the bars and labels\n+    \n+<img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/lecture-transcripts/what-is-the-d3-library-used-for-2.png\" alt=\"A graph with four nodes labeled A, B, C, and D.

Plus, the library is in JavaScript, so you don't need to worry about learning a whole new language.\n+\n+In upcoming workshops and labs, you will learn the fundamentals of the D3 library, like selections, shapes, and scales.
