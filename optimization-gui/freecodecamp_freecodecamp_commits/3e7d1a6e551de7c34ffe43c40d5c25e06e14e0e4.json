But there is another, not recommended way, to work with events in JavaScript.\n+\n+Inline event handlers are special attributes on an HTML element that are used to execute JavaScript code when an event occurs.\n+\n+Here is an example of a `button` element with an inline click event handler:\n+\n+```html\n+<button onclick=\"alert('Hello World!')\">Show alert</button>\n+```\n+\n+When the user clicks on the button, the `alert` function is called and an alert dialog is displayed with the message `Hello World!`.\n+\n+Another way to use inline event handlers is to call a function that is defined in a `script` tag in the HTML document. \n+\n+Here is an example of defining a function called `changeBgColor` and calling it from an inline click event handler:\n+\n+```html\n+<script>\n+  function changeBgColor() {\n+    document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"lightblue\";\n+  }\n+</script>\n+\n+<button onclick=\"changeBgColor()\">Change background color</button>\n+```\n+\n+When the user clicks on the button, the `changeBgColor` function is called and the background color of the page is changed to light blue. While it is possible to use inline event handlers like this, it is not considered a best practice. \n+\n+For one reason, inline event handlers can only be used to attach one event listener to an element. If you want to attach multiple event listeners to the same element, you will need to use `addEventListener()`. Another reason is that inline event handlers mix HTML and JavaScript code together, which can make your code harder to read and maintain. It is better to keep your HTML code and JavaScript code separate by using `addEventListener()` to attach event listeners to elements.\n+\n+Inline event handlers are not recommended for use in modern JavaScript.

An example of this would be when you need to hide or show a menu when a user clicks on a button.\n+\n+In this lecture, you will learn how to manipulate styles using the `Element.style` and `Element.classList` properties.\n+\n+The `Element.style` property is a read-only property that represents the inline style of an element. You can use this property to get or set the style of an element.\n+\n+Here is an example of a paragraph element with an ID of `para`:\n+\n+```html\n+<p id=\"para\">This is a paragraph</p>\n+```\n+\n+You can use the `style` property to change the color of the paragraph element to red:\n+\n+```js\n+const paraEl = document.getElementById(\"para\");\n+paraEl.style.color = \"red\";\n+```\n+\n+The `style` property can be used to set many CSS properties, such as `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and so on.\n+\n+Another way to manipulate styles is by using the `Element.classList` property. The `classList` property is a read-only property that can be used to add, remove, or toggle classes on an element. Let's take a look at a couple of examples.\n+\n+In this first example, you are going to add a class called `highlight` to a paragraph element with an ID of `para`:\n+\n+```html\n+<p id=\"para\">This is a paragraph</p>\n+```\n+\n+In the CSS, we will set the `highlight` class to change the background color of the paragraph element to yellow:\n+\n+```css\n+.highlight {\n+  background-color: yellow;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the JavaScript, we will add the `highlight` class to the paragraph element using the `classList.add()` method:\n+\n+```js\n+const paraEl = document.getElementById(\"para\");\n+paraEl.classList.add(\"highlight\");\n+```\n+\n+You can also add multiple classes to an element by passing them as arguments to the `classList.add()` method:\n+\n+```js\n+classList.add(\"class1\", \"class2\", \"class3\");\n+```\n+\n+If you need to remove a class from an element, you can use the `classList.remove()` method like this:\n+\n+```js\n+classList.remove(\"highlight\");\n+```\n+\n+To toggle a class on an element, you can use the `classList.toggle()` method. In this example, we have a `button` element with an ID of `toggle-btn` and a `nav` element with an ID of `menu`:\n+\n+```html\n+<button id=\"toggle-btn\">Toggle Menu</button>\n+\n+<nav id=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">\n+  <ul>\n+    <li>Home</li>\n+    <li>About</li>\n+    <li>Products</li>\n+  </ul>\n+</nav>\n+```\n+\n+Inside the CSS, we have added some styles for the menu and a class called `show` that will change the `display` property of the `.menu` to `block`:\n+\n+```css\n+.menu {\n+  display: none;\n+  background-color: lightgray;\n+  width: 50%;\n+  padding: 10px;\n+}\n+\n+.menu.show {\n+  display: block;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Inside the JavaScript, we are accessing the menu element and the `button` element using the `getElementById()` method. Then, we are adding an event listener to the `button` element that will toggle the `show` class on the `.menu` element when the button is clicked:\n+\n+```js\n+const menu = document.getElementById(\"menu\");\n+const toggleBtn = document.getElementById(\"toggle-btn\");\n+\n+toggleBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => menu.classList.toggle(\"show\"));\n+```\n+\n+When a user clicks on the button, the `show` class will be added to the `.menu` element, and the menu will be displayed. If the user clicks on the button again, the `show` class will be removed from the `.menu` element, and the menu will be hidden.\n+\n+By using methods and properties such as `style`, `add()`, `remove()`, and `toggle()`, you can easily manipulate an element's styles with JavaScript, creating dynamic and interactive web pages.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

That's where the `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` methods come in handy. Both methods accept two parameters: a function and a delay.\n+\n+Let's look at each of the methods in more detail so you can start using them in your web projects. \n+\n+`setTimeout()` lets you delay an action for a specified time. Here's the basic syntax of the `setTimeout()` method:\n+\n+```js\n+setTimeout(functionToRun, delay);\n+```\n+\n+`functionToRun` is the code you want to execute after a specified delay, and `delay` is the time (in milliseconds) to wait before running the function. Here's an example:\n+\n+```js\n+setTimeout(function () {\n+ console.log(\"This runs after 3 seconds\");\n+}, 3000);\n+```\n+\n+You can also use an arrow function for the callback, like this:\n+\n+```js\n+setTimeout(() => {\n+ console.log(\"This runs after 3 seconds\"); \n+}, 3000);\n+```\n+\n+`setInterval()` keeps repeating a function at a set interval. It's like having an alarm that goes off every few seconds. `setInterval()` is perfect when you want something to happen over and over again, like refreshing data or creating an animation that moves continuously.\n+\n+Just like `setTimeout()`, it takes a function and a delay:\n+\n+```js\n+setInterval(functionToRun, delay);\n+```\n+\n+`functionToRun` is the code you want to run repeatedly, while `delay` is the time in milliseconds between each execution of that function. Here's an example:\n+\n+```js\n+setInterval(() => {\n+ console.log(\"This runs every 2 seconds\");\n+}, 2000);\n+```\n+\n+And here's the result in the console:\n+\n+```md\n+This runs every 2 seconds\n+This runs every 2 seconds\n+This runs every 2 seconds\n+```\n+\n+Since `setInterval()` keeps executing the provided function at the specified interval, you might want to stop it. To do this, you have to use the `clearInterval()` method.\n+\n+To do the work, `clearInterval()` takes the ID of the `setInterval()` you want to stop. This could be a variable you assign the interval to. One way to stop the interval is inside a `setTimeout()`, as that will stop the interval after a certain time:\n+\n+```js\n+const intervalID = setInterval(() => {\n+ console.log(\"This will stop after 5 seconds\");\n+}, 1000);\n+\n+setTimeout(() => {\n+ clearInterval(intervalID);\n+}, 5000);\n+```\n+\n+You can also stop a timeout with the `clearTimeout()` method:\n+\n+```js\n+let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {\n+ console.log(\"This will not run\");\n+}, 5000);\n+\n+clearTimeout(timeoutID);\n+```\n+\n+With that code, the `setTimeout()` will not run at all. So, a more elegant way to do it is through the DOM, by adding a click event listener to a button to stop the timeout:\n+\n+```html\n+<h1>Cancel Timeout Example</h1>\n+<button id=\"cancelButton\">Cancel Timeout</button>\n+\n+<script>\n+   let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {\n+     console.log(\"This will run if not canceled\");\n+   }, 5000);\n+\n+   document\n+   .querySelector(\"#cancelButton\")\n+   .addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n+     clearTimeout(timeoutID);\n+     console.log(\"Timeout canceled!\");\n+   });\n+</script>\n+```\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"
