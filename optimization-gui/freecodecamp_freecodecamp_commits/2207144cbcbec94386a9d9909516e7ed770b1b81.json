They can evaluate complex conditions and different variables in each clause. This makes them suitable for a wider range of scenarios.

Since we are dealing with more complex logical evaluations and multiple variables, it is better to use an `if/else` statement here versus a `switch` statement.\n \n It's worth noting that `switch` statements in JavaScript use strict comparison (`===`), which means they don't perform type coercion. This can be an advantage in terms of predictability and avoiding subtle bugs."
