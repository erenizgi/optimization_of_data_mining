It always returns a string indicating the type.\n \n Let's take a look at a few examples:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let num = 42;\n console.log(typeof num); // \"number\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this first example, we have created a variable called `num` and assigned it the number `42`. When you use the `typeof` operator on the variable named `num`, it will return the string `number`.\n \n Here is another example of using the `typeof` operator on variable called `isUserLoggedIn`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let isUserLoggedIn = true;\n console.log(typeof isUserLoggedIn); // \"boolean\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n When you use the `typeof` operator on the `isUserLoggedIn` variable, it will return a string `boolean` because the boolean `true` was assigned to the variable.\n \n Using the `typeof` operator can be especially useful when you're debugging or trying to understand what kind of data you're working with in your code.\n@@ -33,11 +41,15 @@ However, there's a well-known quirk in JavaScript when it comes to `null`.\n \n Let's take a look at an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let exampleVariable = null;\n console.log(typeof exampleVariable); // \"object\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we have a variable called `exampleVariable` and have assigned it the value of `null`. But when we use the `typeof` operator, it returns the string `object`.\n \n This is widely considered a bug in JavaScript, dating back to its early days. The reason for this behavior is rooted in the way JavaScript was originally designed."
