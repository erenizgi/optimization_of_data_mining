Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the data.\n+- **Advantages of Relational Databases**: Scalable, widely applicable across domains (e.g., healthcare, business, gaming), and structured to maintain reliable data.\n+- **Common Use Cases**: Web development, inventory systems, e-commerce, healthcare, and enterprise applications.\n+\n+## Key Concepts\n+\n+- **Schema**: A relational database requires a schema that defines its structure—tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.\n+- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for each row in a table. They are essential for data integrity and are used to relate records between tables via foreign keys.\n+- **Foreign Keys**: References to primary keys in another table, used to link related data across tables.\n+- **Relationships**: By connecting tables through primary and foreign keys, you can structure normalized data and perform meaningful queries.\n+- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: Visualize how entities (tables) relate to each other in a database schema.\n+- **Data Integrity**: Enforced using keys and data types. Ensures consistency and accuracy of stored data.\n+\n+## SQL Basics\n+\n+- **Queries**: Requests to retrieve specific data from the database.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE age < 3;\n+```\n+\n+- **WHERE clause**: Filter results based on conditions. Use comparison operators like `<`, `=`, `>`, etc.\n+- **Select with ORDER BY**: Retrieve and sort results based on a column.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;\n+```\n+\n+## Table Operations\n+\n+- **`CREATE TABLE` Statement**: This statement is used to create a new table in a database.\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE TABLE first_table();\n+```\n+\n+-

database.\n+\n+```sql\n+ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;\n+```\n+\n+- **`DROP DATABASE` Statement**: This statement is used to drop an entire database.\n+\n+```sql\n+DROP DATABASE database_name;\n+```\n+\n+## Constraints & Data Integrity\n+\n+- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with Constraint**: This statement is used to add a column with a constraint to an existing table.\n+\n+```sql\n+ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINT;\n+```\n+\n+- **`NOT NULL` Constraint**: This constraint ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.\n+\n+```sql\n+column_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n+```\n+\n+- **`ALTER TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY` Statement**: This statement is used to add a primary key constraint to a table.\n+\n+```sql\n+ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);\n+```\n+\n+- **`ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT` Statement**: This statement is used to drop a constraint from a table.\n+\n+```sql\n+ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;\n+```\n+\n+- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with Foreign Key**: This statement is used to add a foreign key column that references another table.\n+\n+```sql\n+ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);\n+```\n+\n+- **`ALTER TABLE ADD UNIQUE` Statement**: This statement is used to add a UNIQUE constraint to a column.\n+\n+```sql\n+ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE(column_name);\n+```\n+\n+- **`ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL` Statement**: This statement is used to set a NOT NULL constraint on an existing column.\n+\n+```sql\n+ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;\n+```\n+\n+- **`INSERT` Statement with NULL Values**: This statement demonstrates how to insert NULL values into a table.\n+\n+```sql\n+INSERT INTO table_name(column_a) VALUES(NULL);\n+-- or\n+INSERT INTO table_name(column_b) VALUES('value'); -- if column_a allows nulls\n+```\n+\n+- **Composite Primary Key**: This constraint defines a primary key that consists of multiple columns.\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE TABLE course_enrollments (\n+    student_id INT,\n+    course_id INT,\n+    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)\n+);\n+```\n+\n+## Data Manipulation (CRUD)\n+\n+- **`INSERT` Statement**: This statement is used to insert a single row into a table.\n+\n+```sql\n+INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);\n+```\n+\n+- **`INSERT` Statement with Omitted Columns**: This statement shows how to insert values without explicitly listing the column names, relying on the default column order in the table.\n+\n+```sql\n+INSERT INTO dogs VALUES ('Gino', 3);\n+```\n+\n+- **`INSERT` Statement with Multiple Rows**: This statement is used to insert multiple rows into a table in a single operation.\n+\n+```sql\n+INSERT INTO dogs (name, age) VALUES \n+('Gino', 3),\n+('Nora', 2);\n+```\n+\n+- **`UPDATE` Statement**: This statement is used to update existing

database.\n+  - One-to-one\n+  - One-to-many\n+  - Many-to-one\n+  - Many-to-many\n+  - Self-referencing (recursive)\n+\n+- **One-to-One Relationship**: This relationship type means that each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table.\n+\n+```md\n+One employee is assigned exactly one vehicle.\n+Tables: employees, vehicles\n+```\n+\n+- **One-to-Many Relationship**: This relationship type means that one record in a table can be associated with multiple records in another table.\n+\n+```md\n+One customer can have many orders.\n+Tables: customers → orders\n+```\n+\n+- **Many-to-Many Relationship via Junction Table**: This relationship type is implemented using a junction table that contains foreign keys from both related tables.\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE TABLE books_authors (\n+    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),\n+    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id)\n+);\n+```\n+\n+- **Self-Referencing Relationships**: This relationship type occurs when a table references itself, creating a hierarchical structure.\n+\n+```md\n+An employee table where each employee may report to another employee.\n+```\n+\n+## Advanced SQL (Joins)\n+\n+- **`INNER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT *\n+FROM products\n+INNER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;\n+```\n+\n+- **`FULL OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows from either table.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT *\n+FROM products\n+FULL OUTER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;\n+```\n+\n+- **`LEFT OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT *\n+FROM products\n+LEFT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;\n+```\n+\n+- **`RIGHT OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT *\n+FROM products\n+RIGHT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;\n+```\n+\n+- **`SELF JOIN` Statement**: This join is used to join a table with itself to compare rows within the same table.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT A.column_name, B.column_name\n+FROM table_name A\n+JOIN table_name B ON A.related_column = B.related_column;\n+```\n+\n+- **`CROSS JOIN` Statement**: This join returns the Cartesian product of two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second table.\n+\n+```sql\n+SELECT *\n+FROM table1\n+CROSS JOIN table2;\n+```\n+\n+## PostgreSQL Specific Commands\n+\n+- **`psql` Login Command**: This command is used to log in to PostgreSQL with specific username and database.\n+\n+```bash\n+psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres\n+```\n+\n+- **`\\l` Command**: This command lists all databases in the PostgreSQL instance.\n+\n+```sql\n+\\l\n+```\n+\n+- **`CREATE DATABASE` and `\\c` Commands**: These commands are used to create a new database and connect to it.\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE DATABASE database_name;\n+\\c database_name\n+```\n+\n+- **`\\d` Command**: This command lists all tables in the current database.\n+\n+```sql\n+\\d\n+```\n+\n+- **`\\d table_name` Command**: This command displays the schema/structure of a specific table.\n+\n+```sql\n+\\d table_name\n+```\n+\n+- **`\\q` Command**: This command exits the PostgreSQL client.\n+\n+```bash\n+\\q\n+```\n+\n+## Relational vs Non-Relational\n+\n+- **Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases**: Store unstructured or semi-structured data. Do not require a rigid schema and are more flexible for evolving data models.\n+- **Choosing Between Relational and Non-Relational**: Depends on the nature of your data and application requirements.\n+- **Relational vs Non-Relational**: Choose relational for structured data and consistency; NoSQL for flexibility and fast-changing data.\n+\n+## Popular RDBMS Systems\n+\n+- **MySQL**: Open-source, reliable, widely used in web development, supported by a large community.\n+- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, advanced, extensible. Supports custom data types and server-side programming.\n+- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based, serverless. Ideal for small applications.\n+- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Proprietary, enterprise-grade database.\n+- **Oracle Database**: Commercial RDBMS known for large-scale performance and scalability.\n+\n+## Best Practices\n+\n+- **Naming Convention**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `delivery_orders`) for table and column names.\n \n # --assignment--\n "
