JavaScript also includes operators for more complex arithmetic operations, such as remainder and exponentiation.\n \n All these tools are called arithmetic operators. Let's look at these operators in detail, how to use them and how to combine them. \n \n The addition operator is a plus sign (`+`). The addition operator allows you to find the total of two or more numbers. In addition operations, the order of the numbers doesn't matter:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const num1 = 10;\n const num2 = 5;\n@@ -27,22 +29,34 @@ console.log(result2); // 15\n console.log(result3); // 30\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The subtraction operator is a minus sign (`-`). It allows you to find the difference between two numbers. Use the minus sign when you want to subtract a number from another number, usually a smaller one from a bigger one:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const difference = 10 - 5;\n console.log(difference); // 5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n If a smaller number comes first, you'll get a negative result:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const difference = 5 - 10;\n console.log(difference); // -5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n You can also assign the numbers to variables and do the subtraction with the variable names:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const num1 = 10;\n const num2 = 5;\n@@ -51,8 +65,12 @@ const result = num1 - num2;\n console.log(result); // 5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In JavaScript, the multiplication operator is represented by an asterisk (`*`) and is used to find the product of two or more numbers.

Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are executed in expressions. You will learn more about operator precedence in future lessons.\n \n # --questions--"
