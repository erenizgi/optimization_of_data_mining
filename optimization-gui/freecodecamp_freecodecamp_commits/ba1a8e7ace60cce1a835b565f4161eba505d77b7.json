When called as a function without `new`, it behaves differently depending on the type of value passed to it. Here's an example of using the `Object()` constructor without the `new` keyword:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const num = 42;\n const numObj = Object(num); // Creates an object wrapper for the number\n@@ -27,17 +29,25 @@ console.log(numObj); // 42\n console.log(typeof numObj); // \"object\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The first `console.log` will show `42`, but it is important to note that this is not a regular number. As you can see in the second `console.log`, `numObj` is an object.  This is happening because we used the `Object()` constructor to turn that input of a number into an object. \n \n What happens if we try to pass `null` or `undefined` to the `Object()` constructor?\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const newObj = new Object(undefined);\n console.log(newObj); // {}\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Well, the result will be an empty object. Another use case for the `Object()` constructor is when you're working with a value of unknown type and you need to ensure it's an object. Let’s take a look at the following example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n function toObject(value) {\n   if (value === null || value === undefined) {\n@@ -58,6 +68,8 @@ console.log(toObject(true));\n console.log(toObject([1, 2, 3]));\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we have a function called `toObject`. The second condition will check if the value is a type of object and will return the value if the condition is `true`. This condition will check for objects as well as arrays since arrays are special types of objects.\n \n If neither of the conditions is true, the function returns `Object(value)`, which converts the input into an object. This works for values like numbers, strings, and booleans"
