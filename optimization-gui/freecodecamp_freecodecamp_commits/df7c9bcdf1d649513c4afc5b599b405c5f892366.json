But how do you know if your projects are working correctly?\n+\n+One option is to do what is called manual testing. This is where a tester will go through each part of the application and test out all of the different features to make sure it works correctly. If any bugs are uncovered in the testing process, the tester will report those bugs back to the software team so they can be fixed.\n+\n+While it is important to manually test out your applications, often times it will not be enough. Real-world applications involve many components and services and can often be complex in nature. So only relying on manual testing will result in many bugs lying beneath the surface that can hurt the usability and maintainability of an application.\n+\n+This is where automated testing comes in. You can write separate test code to check whether your application behaves as expected, without needing to manually click through it. Both manual and automated tests can be grouped into different types, depending on what they are testing.\n+\n+Over the next few lectures, we are going to cover the different types of testing used in the industry like unit testing, end-to-end testing, functional testing and more.\n+\n+Writing tests for your applications will help ensure that your code is doing what it is supposed to be doing. It is important that you start to familiarize yourself with the basics of testing because it will be something that you will need in a developer job.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is the Overall Purpose of Testing Your Applications? question?\n+Why is it important to test your applications?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+You want to ensure that your applications look professional.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Think about how your application is expected to work.\n+\n+---\n+\n+You want to ensure that your applications work as expected.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+You want to ensure that your applications are responsive.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Think about how your application is expected to work.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+You want to ensure that your applications run slower.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Think about how your application is expected to work.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What is manual testing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+This involves running security audits on your site to ensure there are no security risks in your application.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the lecture where this was mentioned.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This involves only testing your JavaScript and CSS files to ensure there are no bugs in them.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the lecture where this was mentioned.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This involves running accessibility audits with automated tools to check for any accessibility errors.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the lecture where this was mentioned.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This involves going through your application and making sure all of the features and sections work as expected.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+4\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is NOT a type of testing used in the industry?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Fisher Yates testing\n+\n+---\n+\n+End-to-end testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the end of the lecture where this was mentioned.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Unit testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the end of the lecture where this was mentioned.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Functional testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the end of the lecture where this was mentioned.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

This is known as the \"single responsibility principle.\" When you have a series of small functions, it is best to test these functions to ensure that everything works as expected. In this lecture, we will take a look at how to create a unit test using the popular Jest testing framework.\n+\n+In this example, we are going to create a function that is responsible for returning a newly formatted string:\n+\n+```js\n+export function getFormattedWord(str) {\n+  if (!str) return '';\n+  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This `getFormattedWord` function has a parameter called `str` and will first check if the `str` is empty. If so, then an empty string is returned. Otherwise, a new string is returned where the first letter is capitalized. We are exporting this function so we can use it in a test file.\n+\n+In a separate `getFormattedWord.test.js` file, we can write some tests to verify that the function is doing what it is supposed to be doing.\n+\n+At the top of the `getFormattedWord.test.js` file, we need to first import the function like this:\n+\n+```js\n+import { getFormattedWord } from \"./getFormattedWord.js\";\n+```\n+\n+Then we need to install the Jest package by using `npm i jest`. Then we can add a test to check that a word made up of lowercase characters, `hello`, is properly formatted to `Hello`, which starts with a capital `H`:\n+\n+```js\n+test('capitalizes the first letter of a word', () => {\n+  expect(getFormattedWord('hello')).toBe('Hello');\n+});\n+```\n+\n+The `expect` function is used to test a value. It's combined with a matcher, which is a function that checks whether the value behaves as expected. In this case the matcher is `toBe()`. Jest has a variety of matchers to help you test for truthiness, strings, numbers, and more.\n+\n+One way to run your tests is by adding an npm script to your `package.json` file. Here's an example script for the Jest framework:\n+\n+```js\n+\"scripts\": {\n+  \"test\": \"jest\"\n+},\n+```\n+\n+Then just run `npm run test` in your terminal to run your tests. If your tests pass, you should see something in the terminal like this:\n+\n+```sh\n+PASS ./getFormattedWord.test.js\n+  ✓ capitalizes the first letter of a word (1 ms)\n+\n+Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\n+Tests:       1 passed, 1 total\n+Snapshots:   0 total\n+Time:        0.103 s, estimated 1 s\n+Ran all test suites.\n+```\n+\n+To see what a failing test looks like, we can intentionally break the test by updating the function to the following:\n+\n+```js\n+export function getFormattedWord(str) {\n+  if (!str) return '';\n+  return \"This is incorrect\";\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Now when you run the `npm run test` command, there will be an error message because the test was expecting a different result:\n+\n+```sh\n+FAIL ./getFormattedWord.test.js\n+  ✕ capitalizes the first letter of a word (1 ms)\n+\n+  ● capitalizes the first letter of a word\n+\n+  expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality\n+\n+  Expected: \"Hello\"\n+  Received: \"This is incorrect\"\n+\n+    2 |\n+    3 | test('capitalizes the first letter of a word', () => {\n+    4 |   expect(getFormattedWord('hello')).toBe('Hello');\n+                                            ^\n+    5 | });\n+    6 |\n+\n+    at Object.toBe (getFormattedWord.test.js:4:37)\n+\n+Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total\n+Tests:       1 failed, 1 total\n+Snapshots:   0 total\n+Time:        0.121 s, estimated 1 s\n+Ran all test suites.\n+```\n+\n+Now we can update our function back to the original here:\n+\n+```js\n+export function getFormattedWord(str) {\n+  if (!str) return '';\n+  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Add another test to check for cases where no argument is provided to `getFormattedWord`:\n+\n+```js\n+test(\"returns an empty string when no argument is provided\", () => {\n+  expect(getFormattedWord()).toBe(\"\");\n+});\n+```\n+\n+There are other tests you can add to make things more robust, but these first couple of tests are a good introduction to unit testing.\n+\n+When it comes to testing JavaScript applications some common testing frameworks include Jest, Mocha, and Vitest.\n+\n+Unit testing is important because it will help you catch more bugs in your programs, and ensure that everything works as expected. It also can serve as a form of documentation for your application because it is meant to represent the expected behavior for your code.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is Unit Testing? question?\n+Which of the following refers to the principle where a function should only be responsible for one thing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Single responsibility principle\n+\n+---\n+\n+Multiple responsibility principle\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the very beginning of the lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Single request principle\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the very beginning of the lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Multiple response principle\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the very beginning of the lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+1\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is NOT a commonly used testing framework in the JavaScript ecosystem?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+JUnit\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Jest\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the end of the lecture where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+Vitest\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the end of the lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Mocha\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the end of the lecture where this was discussed.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n 1\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What can you add to a `package.json` file to run your tests in the terminal?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+```json\n+\"test\": {\n+  \"test\": \"run test\"\n+},\n+```\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Remember that you can create custom scripts in your `package.json` file.\n+\n+---\n+\n+```json\n+\"scriptings\": {\n+  \"jest\"\n+},\n+```\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Remember that you can create custom scripts in your `package.json` file.\n+\n+---\n+\n+```json\n+\"run\": {\n+  \"test\"\n+},\n+```\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Remember that you can create custom scripts in your `package.json` file.\n+\n+---\n+\n+```json\n+\"scripts\": {\n+  \"test\": \"jest\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+4"

Well, unit testing is part of functional testing. Functional testing checks if the features and functions of the application work as expected.\n+\n+In this lecture, we will take a look at the differences between functional and non-functional testing.\n+\n+The goal of functional testing is to test the system as a whole against multiple scenarios to ensure that the system works as expected. An example of functional testing would be smoke testing. Smoke testing is where you perform a preliminary check on the system for basic or critical issues before more extensive testing is done.\n+\n+In contrast, non-functional testing focuses on things like performance and reliability.\n+\n+A real test scenario for functional testing would be a user login. A user should be able to log in to the application with their username and password. If successful, they should be able to access their account information. If there is an issue, then that error needs to be handled properly. When you are writing tests, you need to account for all types of success and failure scenarios.\n+\n+An example of non-functional testing would be to test the performance of your application under different network conditions. In a future lecture video, you will learn more about performance testing.\n+\n+The reasons why functional testing is so important is because you want to identify bugs early on in your application. You also want to make sure that your application meets the requirements that were laid out at the beginning of the planning phase. Lastly, you want to ensure that your users have a good user experience. Users should not struggle to use your application or be blocked by broken features and system failures.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is Functional Testing, and How Does It Differ from Unit Testing? question?\n+What is functional testing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+This tests for accessibility issues only and ensures there is 100% test coverage.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This tests for performance issues and ensures the application performance is strong.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This tests the system as a whole to ensure that the system works as expected.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This tests for CSS issues only and ensures there is 100% test coverage.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+3\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is an example of non-functional testing?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+Testing the CSS of your application to make sure the styles look correct.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Testing the HTML of your application to ensure there are no bugs.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Testing the JavaScript files in your application to ensure they only use arrow functions.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+Testing the performance of your application under different network conditions.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+4\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is an example of functional testing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Agile testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Regex testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Smoke testing\n+\n+---\n+\n+Class testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-1\n+3"

Examples of E2E testing scenarios include testing the registration and login process or testing the checkout for an e-commerce site.\n+\n+To better understand how end-to-end testing works, let's take a look at a real-world example from the freeCodeCamp codebase. This example uses Playwright, a popular end-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft.\n+\n+Inside the freeCodeCamp codebase, there is a directory called `e2e` which holds tests for donations, certifications, exams and more. Inside the directory, there is a `donate-page-donor.spec.ts` file which has tests for the authenticated donor supporter page.\n+\n+The first step is to navigate to the donation page as a demo user who is already a supporter:\n+\n+```js\n+test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n+  execSync(\"node ./tools/scripts/seed/seed-demo-user --set-true isDonating\");\n+  await page.goto(\"/donate\");\n+});\n+```\n+\n+Since there are multiple tests in this file, the `beforeEach` hook will run before each of the tests.\n+\n+Once the user is on the donation page, they will see a thank you message with suggestions on how to support freeCodeCamp further. Here are just a few of the tests to check for some of the text found on the donation page:\n+\n+```js\n+test(\"should render the donate page correctly\", async ({ page }) => {\n+  await expect(\n+    page.getByText(\"Thank you for your continued support\")\n+  ).toBeVisible();\n+\n+  await expect(\n+    page.getByText(\n+      \"Your contributions are crucial in creating resources that empower millions of people to learn new skills and support their families.\"\n+    )\n+  ).toBeVisible();\n+\n+  ...\n+});\n+```\n+\n+There are also tests to check that the donor has a supporter link in the menu bar, as well as a special stylized border around their avatar to indicate they are a supporter:\n+\n+```js\n+test(\"The menu should have a supporters link\", async ({ page }) => {\n+  const menuButton = page.getByTestId(\"header-menu-button\");\n+  const menu = page.getByTestId(\"header-menu\");\n+\n+  await expect(menuButton).toBeVisible();\n+  await menuButton.click();\n+\n+  await expect(menu).toBeVisible();\n+\n+  await expect(page.getByRole(\"link\", { name: \"Supporters\" })).toBeVisible();\n+});\n+\n+test(\"The Avatar should have a special border for donors\", async ({ page }) => {\n+  const container = page.locator(\".avatar-container\");\n+  await expect(container).toHaveClass(\"avatar-container gold-border\");\n+});\n+```\n+\n+By having these types of detailed tests, you can increase the test coverage for your application beyond just unit tests. End-to-end tests also help ensure that your application behaves correctly, and is predictable for users. Examples of other end-to-end testing tools include Cypress, Selenium, and Puppeteer.\n+\n+While end-to-end testing is important, it is expensive because it is time-consuming to set up, design, and maintain. E2E tests are great for critical user flows, while unit tests are great for testing small units in the application.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is End-to-End Testing? question?\n+Which of the following is NOT an example of a commonly used E2E testing tool?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+Cypress\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Selenium\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Agile\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+Puppeteer\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+3\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is a popular end-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Playwright\n+\n+---\n+\n+Java\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Angular\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+JUnit\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n 1\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is a commonly used test scenario for end-to-end tests?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Testing the validity of CSS code.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Testing the performance for an application.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Testing the validity of HTML code.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Testing the user login process.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+4"

This type of testing involves users interacting with the different features of the application to better understand how they work. The goal here is to identify any potential issues in the application so they can be addressed early on and resolved.\n+\n+The second type of usability testing is comparative testing. This is where you compare your application's user experience with similar applications in the marketplace. The goal is to see where your application falls short compared to the competition so those areas can be improved on.\n+\n+The third type of usability testing is assessment testing. This is where you study how intuitive the application is to use and if there are any major blockers for users. This type of testing will result in reduced costs and headaches once the application is live to thousands or even millions of users down the line.\n+\n+The last type of usability testing is validation testing. This is where you identify any major issues that will prevent the user from using the application effectively. This type of testing usually happens after the initial development stage and just before the final release of the application.\n+\n+There are many tools out there to assist with usability testing, but here are a few popular ones to be aware of:\n+\n+- Loop11\n+\n+- Maze\n+\n+- Userbrain\n+\n+- UserTesting and\n+\n+- UXTweak\n+\n+It is important to note that functional testing is not the same as usability testing.

How will these applications work on a variety of devices, operating systems, and browsers? Well, this is where compatibility testing comes in.\n+\n+The goal of compatibility testing is to see how well your software works in a variety of different computing environments. This provides the team with the ability to catch bugs before they reach production and will help contribute to a smoother product launch.\n+\n+Different types of compatibility testing include backwards and forwards compatibility, hardware testing, operating systems, networks, browsers, and mobile devices.\n+\n+Let's take a look at each of the types in more detail by starting with backwards and forwards compatibility. Backwards compatibility refers to when current software is compatible with earlier versions. Forwards compatibility is when software and systems will work with future versions of itself.\n+\n+The next type of testing is for hardware. Hardware compatibility testing focuses on the software's ability to work properly in different hardware configurations. This includes components like processors, memory, different storage types, and graphics cards.\n+\n+Another type of compatibility testing is for operating systems. You don't want to design software that works smoothly on Mac devices but has bugs on Windows or vice versa. You also need to consider Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora.\n+\n+The next type of testing is network compatibility testing. You will have users working with different network speeds, protocols, security settings, and more. Therefore, software teams will need to be mindful of all of those different conditions when testing.\n+\n+Then, there's browser compatibility testing. There are a few popular browsers in the market like Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and more. Since all browsers work slightly differently, it's important to test your web application thoroughly and make sure your web applications work consistently across many browsers.\n+\n+The last type of testing is mobile testing. There was a time in web development when most developers didn't think about testing for mobile devices. This was because, in the early 2000s, mobile devices weren't nearly as powerful or widely used as they are today. But now, tens of millions of people visit websites on phones and tablets. So, it is important to ensure that your software applications work on a variety of Android and iOS devices.\n+\n+Those are just a few types of testing that you will need to consider when building out your applications.

Performance testing is what you do when you test an application's speed, responsiveness, scalability, and stability under different workloads. The goal is to resolve any type of performance bottleneck before it reaches your users.\n+\n+In this video, we will go through a few types of performance testing.\n+\n+The first type is load testing. A load in this context refers to the amount of work or demand put on a system. Load testing determines how a system behaves during normal and peak load times. The goal is to analyze metrics like response times and resource usage and determine if the current software build is ready or not.\n+\n+Another type of testing is stress testing. This is where you test your application in extreme loads and see how well your system responds to the higher load. The goal here is to identify any bottlenecks and vulnerabilities by testing the system beyond its limits.\n+\n+The next type of performance testing is soak testing, also known as endurance testing. This is a type of load testing where you test the system with a higher load for an extended period of time. The goal here is to determine any types of memory leaks and performance degradation.\n+\n+Another type of testing is spike testing. This is where you dramatically increase and decrease the loads and analyze the system's reactions to the changes. The goal here is to see if your system will fail with these dramatic changes in the load.\n+\n+Finally, there's breakpoint testing, also known as capacity testing. This is where the load will slowly increment over time to the point where the system starts to fail or degrade. The goal here is to better understand the system's limits and capacities.\n+\n+These are just a few types of performance testing you can do on your applications. Since performance plays a vital role in software development, it is important that your perform these types of tests to ensure that your application doesn't have any major issues and provides a smooth experience for users.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is Performance Testing? question?\n+What is performance testing?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+Testing for an application's linting, formatting, and stability under different workloads.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Testing for an application's accessibility, scalability and linting under different workloads.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+Testing for an application's version control, scalability and formatting under different workloads.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Testing for an application's speed, responsiveness, scalability and stability under different workloads.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+4\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is NOT a type of performance testing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+CPU testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+One of these options refers to the \"brain\" of a computer and is not a type of performance testing.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Load testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+One of these options refers to the \"brain\" of a computer and is not a type of performance testing.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Stress testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+One of these options refers to the \"brain\" of a computer and is not a type of performance testing.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Breakpoint testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+One of these options refers to the \"brain\" of a computer and is not a type of performance testing.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n 1\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following tests dramatically increase and decrease the loads and analyze the system's reactions to the changes?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Load testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Spike testing\n+\n+---\n+\n+Accessibility testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Stress testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2"

But it can also be a dangerous place if you are not careful. There are many hackers and cyber criminals out there looking for new ways to breach websites and compromise data.\n+\n+You've probably heard of a few high-profile data breaches that affected billion-dollar companies like Meta and Microsoft. When it comes to working on web applications, you will need to do thorough security testing to help identity vulnerabilities and weaknesses.\n+\n+Here are a few principles to be aware of when it comes to performing security audits and testing:\n+\n+- Confidentiality: This protects against the release of sensitive information to other recipients that aren't the intended recipient.\n+\n+- Integrity: This involves preventing malicious users from modifying user information.\n+\n+- Authentication: This involves verifying the user's identity to ensure that they are allowed to use that system.\n+\n+- Authorization: This is the process of determining what actions authenticated users are allowed to perform or which parts of the system they are permitted to access.\n+\n+- Availability: This ensures that information and services are available to authorized users when they need it.\n+\n+- Non-repudiation: This ensures that both the sender and recipient have proof of delivery and verification of the sender's identity. It protects against the sender denying having sent the information.\n+\n+Now that we understand the reasoning behind security testing, let's take a look at a few common security threats:\n+\n+- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): You learned about this in an earlier lecture. But as a refresher, XSS attacks happen when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page that is viewed by other users. These scripts can then execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies and session data or performing other malicious actions without the user's knowledge or consent.\n+\n+- SQL Injection: SQL is a language for managing and storing information in a relational database. SQL injection allows malicious users to inject malicious code into a database. You will learn more SQL, relational databases, and SQL injection in a future module.\n+\n+- Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack: This is when malicious users flood a website with a high number of requests or traffic, causing the server to slow down and possibly crash, making the site unavailable to users.\n+\n+There are many more types of security threats, but there are many tools you can use to help protect your web applications and make them more secure. Here are the broad categories that security testing tools fall into:\n+\n+- Static application security testing: These tools are used to evaluate the source code for an application to identify security vulnerabilities.\n+\n+- Dynamic application security testing (DAST): These tools interface with the application's frontend to uncover potential security weaknesses. Unlike static application security testing, DAST tools do not have access to the source code.\n+\n+Another type of security testing is penetration testing (or pentest for short). This involves creating simulated cyberattacks on the application to identify any vulnerabilities in the system. Mid to large-sized companies might have a team of dedicated cybersecurity professionals that perform pentests on a regular basis as part of their regular security audits.\n+\n+The world of cybersecurity is very vast and detailed. But every developer should understand a few common threats against web applications and ways to guard against them.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is Security Testing? question?\n+Which of the following is NOT a core principle when it comes to performing security audits and testing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Integrity\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+One of these options is a type of attack and not a core principle for security testing.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Cross Scripting\n+\n+---\n+\n+Availability\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+One of these options is a type of attack and not a core principle for security testing.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Non-repudiation\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+One of these options is a type of attack and not a core principle for security testing.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following involves malicious users to inject malicious code into a database?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+SQL injection\n+\n+---\n+\n+Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where common security threats were discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Static application injection\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where common security threats were discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+Cross-site Scripting (XSS)\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where common security threats were discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+1\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following involves creating simulated cyberattacks on the application to identify any vulnerabilities in the system?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Penetration testing\n+\n+---\n+\n+Unit testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where common security threats were discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Smoke testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where common security threats were discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Integration testing\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where common security threats were discussed.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

The Software Development Life Cycle is commonly used by software teams to build and deploy applications.\n+\n+In this video, we will break down the different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the role that testing plays in it.\n+\n+Here are the standard stages used in the Software Development Life Cycle:\n+\n+- Planning stage\n+\n+- Design stage\n+\n+- Implementation stage\n+\n+- Testing stage\n+\n+- Deployment stage and\n+\n+- Maintenance stage\n+\n+Let's take a closer look at all of those stages in more detail.\n+\n+In the planning stage, the development team collects requirements for the proposed work from the stakeholders. A stakeholder is someone with a vested interest in the success of the product or service. Examples of stakeholders could be investors, owners, or even other employees. The planning phase also includes estimating costs for the work and creating a schedule for when the work will be completed.\n+\n+The next stage is the Design stage. In this phase, the software team breaks down the requirements and decide on the best approaches for solutions. This includes deciding on which external tools can be used to help things along and what internal tooling needs to be built to get the job done.\n+\n+After the design stage, you have the implementation stage. This involves the software team breaking down the requirements into manageable tasks that they divide up amongst themselves and build out.\n+\n+Once the implementation stage is complete, the software team moves into the testing stage. This involves manual and automated testing for the new work. Sometimes the team tests out the application throughout the entire development stage to catch and fix any issues that come up.\n+\n+The next stage is the deployment stage. This is where the team deploys the new changes to a build or testing environment. This allows the team to test out the application some more and fix any issues before the changes go to production. The production application is the app that end users will use.\n+\n+The last stage is the maintenance stage. This involves fixing any issues that arise from customers in the production application. This also involves monitoring the system for any possible improvements on the software.\n+\n+Finally, there are different models of the Software Development Life Cycle used in the industry, such as Waterfall and Agile. The Waterfall model is where each phase of the life cycle needs to be completed before the next phase can begin. In contrast, the Agile model focuses on iterative development by breaking down work into sprints so teams can quickly make changes and deliver work over time.\n+\n+By going through the Software Development Life Cycle, the development team and stakeholders can be on the same page when it comes to requirements, cost estimates, and schedules. This makes for more efficient collaboration and communication across the board.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is the Software Development Life Cycle, and How Does It Relate to Testing? question?\n+Which of the following is NOT a stage used in the Software Development Life Cycle?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+Planning Stage\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Testing Stage\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Regression Stage\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+Deployment Stage\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+3\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What is the design stage?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+This is where the team will collect requirements and deadlines from stakeholders.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This is where the team will break down the requirements and design solutions.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This is where the team will only focus on UI development.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This is where the team will only create Figma and Sketch mockups of the work to be done.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer back to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What does the Agile model focus on?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Iterative development\n+\n+---\n+\n+Slow development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Expensive development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+UI/UX development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

Those approaches are TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development).\n+\n+Let's first take a look at TDD. Test-Driven Development is a methodology that emphasizes writing tests first before building out the features for an application.\n+\n+Here is the typical process for TDD:\n+\n+1. Write a test\n+\n+2. Ensure that it fails\n+\n+3. Write the code for that test\n+\n+4. Ensure that the test passes this time\n+\n+5. Make any necessary refactors to the code\n+\n+Repeat steps 1-5.\n+\n+Writing tests before building out features provides real-time feedback to developers during the development process. It also helps with catching bugs earlier on in the development stage.\n+\n+While some software teams will choose to follow the TDD approach, TDD is a polarizing topic in the industry. You will find tons of articles and videos out there both advocating for or bashing TDD. Regardless of how you feel about this approach, it is important to be aware of it because you might come across it in real-world scenarios.\n+\n+The second testing approach we will take a look at is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Behavior-Driven Development is the approach of aligning a series of tests with business goals. These tests should be written in a language that can be understood by both technical and non-technical individuals.\n+\n+When testing for specific behaviors in a software application, BDD commonly uses the Gherkin language, which is used in businesses to describe behaviors and scenarios. The Gherkin language uses Given, When, and Then statements when describing scenarios.\n+\n+Here is an example:\n+\n+**Scenario:** Creating a New Blog Post\n+\n+**Given** the user is logged into their account and is on the \"Create New Post\" page,\n+\n+**When** the user enters a title and content for the post and clicks the \"Publish\" button,\n+\n+**Then** the blog post should be saved and displayed on the homepage with the correct title, content, and timestamp.\n+\n+You first want to define a scenario. Example scenarios include when a user logs into an application or places an order on a website. In this example, the scenario is for a user creating a new blog post on a site.\n+\n+After the scenario is defined, you should start with a Given statement. This provides context for where the user is starting before performing an action. The When statement is used to represent the action taken by the user.\n+\n+Finally, the Then statement is used to represent the desired outcome from the previous action taken by the user. Once you define all of your scenarios, you can write tests for each scenario.\n+\n+Examples of BDD testing frameworks include Cucumber, JBehave, and SpecFlow.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Are BDD and TDD? question?\n+What does TDD stand for?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+Tab-Driven Development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of lecture where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Test-Driven Development\n+\n+---\n+\n+Table-Driven Development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of lecture where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+TCP-Driven Development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What does BDD stand for?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Babel-driven development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Byte-driven development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Behavior-Driven development\n+\n+---\n+\n+Backend-driven development\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+3\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following languages is used in businesses to describe behaviors and scenarios?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Gherkin\n+\n+---\n+\n+Rust\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Chai\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of lecture where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+JUnit\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of lecture where this was discussed.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

But as a review, unit testing is what you do when you write tests for units of code. Assertions are used to test that the code is behaving as expected.\n+\n+In this lecture, we are going to take a closer look at assertions in unit tests and explore some best practices.\n+\n+A commonly used assertion library is Chai. This is the same library used inside of the freeCodeCamp codebase. Whenever you go through a workshop or lab, there is an automated test suite that runs against your code to ensure that your code is behaving the way it is supposed to.\n+\n+Let's take a look at a few examples that are from the Full Stack Developer Curriculum.\n+\n+In Build a Calculator workshop, Step 1 is testing for a function called `addTwoAndSeven`:\n+\n+```js\n+assert.isFunction(addTwoAndSeven);\n+```\n+\n+That assertion checks that the provided code contains a function named `addTwoAndSeven`. If the user creates an array, string, or anything else that's not a function and assigns it to `addTwoAndSeven`, then the test will fail.\n+\n+Let's take a look at another assertion from later in the workshop:\n+\n+```js\n+assert.equal(addThreeAndFour(), 7);\n+```\n+\n+This assertion checks that the return value from the `addThreeAndFour` function is equal to the number `7`. If the return value does not equal `7`, then the test will fail.\n+\n+There are many more asserts built into Chai, like ones that check if a value is a boolean, if an object has a certain property name, or if a value is `null`. Other common JavaScript assertion libraries are should.js and expect.js.\n+\n+Regardless of which assertion library you are working with, there are a few best practices to be aware of. The first is to write clear assert messages. Clear and meaningful assert messages should describe the intent behind it. Otherwise, it will be difficult to locate which tests are failing.\n+\n+Another best practice is to write descriptive failure messages.

But in this video, we will dive a little bit deeper into mocking, faking and stubbing.\n+\n+Mocking is the process of replacing real data with false data that simulates the behavior of real components. This allows testers and developers to test for specific components in the application without having to rely on external dependencies.\n+\n+A common use case for mocking data would be when dealing with API calls. Imagine you have a fetch call like this in your application:\n+\n+```js\n+export const postService = {\n+  async getPosts() {\n+    const response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/posts\");\n+    return response.json();\n+  },\n+};\n+```\n+\n+If you need to test the `postService` function, you could mock the API response instead of making continuous API calls to fetch the data. Fetching from an API takes time and depends on external factors like network availability and server responses. Mocking the API response removes those external factors and allows testers to work with a predictable, controlled data set.\n+\n+Here is an example mock API response:\n+\n+```json\n+[\n+  {\n+    \"id\": 1,\n+    \"title\": \"Understanding Async/Await in JavaScript\",\n+    \"content\": \"Async/Await makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code...\",\n+    \"author\": \"Jane Doe\",\n+    \"created_at\": \"2025-04-10T14:32:00Z\"\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"id\": 2,\n+    \"title\": \"10 Tips for Writing Clean Code\",\n+    \"content\": \"Clean code is not just about code formatting. It involves naming, architecture...\",\n+    \"author\": \"John Smith\",\n+    \"created_at\": \"2025-04-08T09:21:00Z\"\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"id\": 3,\n+    \"title\": \"Exploring React 19 Features\",\n+    \"content\": \"React 19 comes with exciting features like new hooks and better performance...\",\n+    \"author\": \"Alex Lee\",\n+    \"created_at\": \"2025-04-07T18:47:00Z\"\n+  }\n+]\n+```\n+\n+Now that we understand what mocking is, let's compare it with stubbing. Stubs are objects that return pre-defined responses or dummy data for an expected behavior in an application. For example, you can stub the behavior for a database connection in your tests without having to rely on an actual database connection.\n+\n+Here is an example of a stub in Jest:\n+\n+```js\n+import { postService } from \"./postService\";\n+import { db } from \"./db\";\n+\n+jest.mock(\"./db\", () => ({\n+  db: {\n+    fetchPosts: jest.fn(),\n+  },\n+}));\n+\n+test(\"should return stubbed posts\", async () => {\n+  const fakePosts = [\n+    { id: 1, title: \"Stubbed Post\", content: \"This is a stubbed post.\" },\n+  ];\n+\n+  db.fetchPosts.mockResolvedValue(fakePosts);\n+\n+  const posts = await postService.getPosts();\n+\n+  expect(posts).toEqual(fakePosts);\n+});\n+```\n+\n+`db.fetchPosts.mockResolvedValue(fakePosts);` is the stub in this example.\n+\n+The last component to discuss are fakes. Fakes are simplified versions of real components without the complexity or side effects of the real thing. For example, you can fake a database by storing the data in memory instead of interacting with the real database. This will allow you to mimic database operations in memory, which will be much faster than dealing with the real database. Another common example would be to use fakes when working with file systems. You can create a fake file system in place of the real one when it comes to testing.\n+\n+As you continue to build out more complex software applications, consider using mocks, stubs, or fakes where appropriate in your testing.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Are the Differences Between Mocking, Faking, and Stubbing?  question?\n+Which of the following is a common use case to use a mock in testing?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+Mocking HTML changes.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Mocking CSS changes.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Mocking API calls.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+Mocking JavaScript string methods.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+3\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What are stubs in testing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Objects that return null in testing environments.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Think about what controlled responses you want to work with in testing scenarios.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Objects that return pre-defined responses.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Objects that make multiple API calls.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Think about what controlled responses you want to work with in testing scenarios.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Objects that make several updates to the UI in React applications.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Think about what controlled responses you want to work with in testing scenarios.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is a common use case for a fake?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Faking API calls for post requests.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Faking the styles for an application.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Faking an HTML file.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Refer to the end of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+Faking a database.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-1\n+4"

This might include sites like X, Discord, or freeCodeCamp. But have you ever wondered why you often see small changes to the design of your most frequently visited pages? Well, this doesn't happen by accident.\n+\n+Companies spend a lot of time analyzing analytics and studying user behavior. They do this to identify pain points in the user experience for their site or application. These companies then use that data to come up with solutions to create a smoother user experience.\n+\n+One of the techniques companies employ is called A/B testing. This type of testing involves comparing two versions of a page or application and studying which version performs better. Sometimes, this type of testing is known as bucket or split testing.\n+\n+Let's take a look at an example so you can better understand the concept. Imagine you have a landing page with some introductory text and a CTA (call to action) button. Remember that a CTA button is used to encourage users to perform a specific action, like donate or log in.\n+\n+As you go through the site analytics, you realize that the click-through rate for the CTA is low. So you try redesigning that button so it's more prominent on the page. You increase the size of the button and change the button color from blue to green. To actually see if those changes made a difference, you can use A/B testing.\n+\n+You can randomly divide your users into two groups. Group A is the control group, which sees the original version of the page with the  smaller blue button, while group B is the experimental group, which see the new version of the page with the larger green button. If the new version of the page results in a higher click-through rate, then you can confidently replace the old button styling with the new one.\n+\n+Examples of tools to use for A/B testing include GrowthBook and LaunchDarkly.\n+\n+There are many common use cases for A/B testing like testing ads, email campaigns, or new product features.

This is known as a regression.\n+\n+To help catch these issues before they happen, you can use regression testing. Regression testing is when you re-run functional tests against parts of your application to ensure that everything still works as expected.

They include Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium, and Cypress.\n+\n+There are also a few testing techniques to be aware of when it comes to regression testing. The first is called unit regression testing. This is where you have a list of items that need to be tested each time major changes or fixes are implemented into the app.\n+\n+Another testing technique is called partial regression testing. This involves targeted approaches to ensure that new changes have not broken specific aspects of the application.\n+\n+Finally, there's complete regression testing. This is the most time-consuming and detailed option, which looks at all the functionalities affected by the recent changes in the codebase and runs tests against them.\n+\n+It's important to note that retesting and regression testing are different. Retesting is used to check for known issues and ensure that they have been resolved, whereas regression testing searches for unknown issues that might have occurred through recent changes in the codebase.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What Is Regression Testing? question?\n+What is retesting?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+This re-runs tests for issues found in JavaScript files only and fixes them.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the last part of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This tests for unknown issues that might have resulted in recent additions to the codebase.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the last part of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This re-runs tests for known HTML-related issues and fixes them.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the last part of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This tests for known issues and ensures that they have been resolved.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+4\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What is a regression in software?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-Answer 1\n+This is where new changes unintentionally break JavaScript code only.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 2\n+This is where changes break existing HTML and CSS code only.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-Answer 3\n+This is where new changes unintentionally break existing functionality.\n+\n+---\n+\n+This is where new changes enhance existing functionality.\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+3\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following is NOT a commonly used tool for regression testing?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+Svelte\n+\n+---\n+\n+Puppeteer\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Playwright\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Selenium\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Review the beginning of the video where this was discussed.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "
