When you are building a website, you'll often style images to display in a specific size. For example, you might have an image display at a 640x480 resolution. 640 represents the width while 480 represents the height in pixels. When preparing your image you want to scale it to a 640x480 size to match that styling. If you serve an image that is 1920x1080 but you are styling it to be much smaller, you're requiring your users to download unnecessary data.
