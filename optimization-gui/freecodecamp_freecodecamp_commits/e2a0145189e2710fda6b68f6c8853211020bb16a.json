The outer braces indicate a JavaScript expression in JSX, while the inner braces define a JavaScript object literal. This syntax allows you to embed JavaScript objects directly in JSX attributes.\n+\n Sometimes you might want to pass in an object directly if there are only a few properties like shown here. Otherwise, passing in a name to an object would be better like in the first example.\n \n It's important to note that while CSS property names are typically written in kebab case, like `font-size`, in React's inline styles, we use camel case, like `fontSize`. This is because the style object is a JavaScript object, and kebab case names are not valid as object keys in JavaScript without using quotes."
