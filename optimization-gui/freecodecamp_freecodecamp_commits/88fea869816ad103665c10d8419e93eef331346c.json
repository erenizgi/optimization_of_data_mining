Grids will have rows and columns with gaps between them. To define a grid layout, you would set the `display` property to `grid`.\n - **The `fr` (Fractional) Unit**: This unit represents a fraction of the space within the grid container. You can use the `fr` unit to create flexible grids.\n - **Creating Gaps Between Tracks**: There are three ways to create gaps between tracks in CSS grid. You can use the `column-gap` property to create gaps between columns. You can use the `row-gap` property to create gaps between rows. Or you can use the `gap` shorthand property to create gaps between both rows and columns.\n - **`repeat()` Function**: This function is used to repeat sections in the track listing. Instead of writing `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;` you can use the `repeat()` function instead. "
