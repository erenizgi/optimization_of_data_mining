This means you can apply styles to elements that have specific attributes or even certain values for those attributes. \n+The attribute selector in CSS is a powerful tool that allows you to target HTML elements based on their attributes. This means you can apply styles to elements that have specific attributes or even certain values for those attributes.\n \n It's particularly useful when you want to style elements dynamically or when class names alone don't provide enough specificity.\n \n-For example, you can use the attribute selector to target all links that have an `href` attribute. This is especially handy when you want to apply a uniform style to all links on a page. \n+For example, you can use the attribute selector to target all links that have an `href` attribute. This is especially handy when you want to apply a uniform style to all links on a page.\n \n Here's how you can use the attribute selector to target links with the `href` attribute:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<a href=\"https://example.com\">Example link with an href attribute</a>\n+<a>Example link without an href attribute</a>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n+a {\n+  display: block;\n+}\n+\n a[href] {\n   color: blue;\n   text-decoration: underline;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This CSS rule will apply a blue color and an underline to any link that includes an `href` attribute, ensuring that all clickable links are styled consistently.\n \n But attribute selectors can be more specific. Suppose you want to target only the links that have a `title` attribute. The `title` attribute often provides additional information about the link, and you might want to style these links differently to indicate that they have extra information available. Here's how you can do it:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<a href=\"https://example.com\" title=\"Example link with a title attribute\">Example link with a title attribute</a>\n+<a>Example link without a title or href attribute</a>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n+a {\n+  display: block;\n+}\n+\n a[title] {\n   font-weight: bold;\n   text-decoration: none;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This rule applies bold text and removes the underline from any link with a `title` attribute. It's a great way to visually differentiate these links from others on the page.\n \n You can also combine attribute selectors to get even more precise. For example, if you want to style links that have both `href` and `title` attributes, you can do this:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<a href=\"https://example.com\" title=\"Example link with a title attribute\">Example link with a title attribute</a>\n+<a>Example link without a title or href attribute</a>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n+a {\n+  display: block;\n+}\n+\n a[href][title] {\n+  display:block;\n   color: green;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this case, only links that contain both `href` and `title` attributes will be styled with green text. This level of control is what makes attribute selectors so powerful in CSS.\n \n Another example for an attribute selector is to match a single value within a space-separated list of values in an attribute.\n@@ -55,36 +98,63 @@ Here is an example of an anchor element with multiple classes:\n \n To target this specific anchor element, you can use the following selector:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<a href=\"https://example.com\" class=\"btn primary large\">Visit Example Site</a>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n a[class~=\"primary\"] {\n   color: red;\n   font-weight: bold;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The `[attr~=value]` syntax is used here to target all anchor elements where the class attribute contains the word `\"primary\"`.\n \n If you need to target an element where the attribute value is prefixed by a specific value, then you can use the `[attr^=value]` syntax.
