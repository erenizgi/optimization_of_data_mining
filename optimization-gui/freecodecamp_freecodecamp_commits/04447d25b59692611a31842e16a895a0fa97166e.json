Don't worry about trying to understand all of the code. The goal of the examples is to show you previews for these design concepts so you better understand how things work.\n \n Adding images to your websites is a great way to engage your users and increase the visual appeal of your site. But there are a few things to consider when working with images in your designs.\n \n The first thing to consider is creating responsive images. Responsive images are images that scale to fit the size of the screen they are being viewed on.
