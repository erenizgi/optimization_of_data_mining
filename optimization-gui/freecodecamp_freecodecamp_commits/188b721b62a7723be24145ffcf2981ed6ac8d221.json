It takes an array and a function (`operation`) as arguments. It then applies the operation to each element of the array. The double function is passed as an argument to `operateOnArray`, demonstrating how functions can be used as values.\n \n Higher order functions can also return functions. This is particularly useful for creating specialized functions based on more general ones. This concept is often referred to as function factories.
