Several tools are available to help developers and designers check and maintain appropriate color contrast ratios on their sites. One popular tool is WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker.\n \n This online tool allows you to input the foreground and background colors of your design and instantly see if they meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards. It's user-friendly and provides immediate feedback on whether your color choices pass or fail the contrast requirements.\n \n To use WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker, simply visit their website and enter the hexadecimal codes for your foreground and background colors. The tool will then calculate the contrast ratio and indicate whether it meets the WCAG 2.0 level AA or AAA standards. Here's an example of how you might use color values in your CSS:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<p>Hello, World!</p>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n body {\n   background-color: #FFFFFF;\n   color: #333333;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we've set a white background (`#FFFFFF`) and dark gray text (`#333333`). You can input these color codes into the WebAIM tool to check their contrast ratio.\n \n Another valuable tool is the TPGi Colour Contrast Analyzer. This desktop application offers more advanced features compared to online tools. It allows you to analyze entire web pages, not just individual color pairs. You can use its color picker to select colors directly from your screen, making it easier to check contrast ratios for existing designs."
