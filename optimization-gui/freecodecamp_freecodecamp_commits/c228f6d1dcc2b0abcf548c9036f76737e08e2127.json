Here's an example of how to use the `delete` operator:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const person = {\n   name: \"Alice\",\n@@ -23,10 +25,14 @@ delete person.job;\n console.log(person.job); // undefined\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we start with a `person` object that has three properties: `name`, `age`, and `job`. Then, we use the `delete` operator to remove the `job` property. After the deletion, the `person` object no longer has the `job` property.\n \n Another way to remove properties is by using destructuring assignment with rest parameters. This approach doesn't actually delete the property, but it creates a new object without the specified properties:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const person = {\n   name: \"Bob\",\n@@ -41,6 +47,8 @@ const { job, city, ...remainingProperties } = person;\n console.log(remainingProperties);\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we use destructuring to extract `job` and `city` from the `person` object, and collect the remaining properties into a new object called `remainingProperties`. This creates a new object without the `job` and `city` properties.\n \n Understanding how to remove properties from objects is an important skill in JavaScript programming. It allows you to manipulate objects dynamically, and clean up unnecessary data."
