As of mid-2023, it's supported in Chrome, Edge, and Opera, with Firefox support behind a flag. For broader browser support, it's important to provide fallbacks and use feature detection.\n+The CSS `@property` rule is considered widely available across all major modern browser engines (like Chrome, Edge, Opera, Firefox, and Safari) since early-2024. If you want to support earlier browsers you need to provide fallback CSS as explained above.\n \n In conclusion, the `@property` rule represents a significant advancement in how we work with custom properties in CSS. It provides more control and enables new possibilities like animation of custom properties. However, it's important to use it judiciously and always provide appropriate fallbacks to ensure a good experience across all browsers. As with any cutting-edge web technology, the key is to enhance the experience for browsers that support it while ensuring basic functionality for those that don't.\n "
