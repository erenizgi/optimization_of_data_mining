You will write a function that randomly returns `\"rock\"`, `\"paper\"` or `\"scissors\"`.\n+\n+You do not need to worry about the front-end part of the game. You will only write the logic for the game. Open the `script.js` and start following the instructions.\n+\n+**User stories:**\n+\n+1. You should have a function named `getComputerChoice`.\n+\n+1. Your `getComputerChoice` function should return `\"rock\"`, `\"paper\"`, or `\"scissors\"` at random.\n+\n+**Hint:** The [Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) method returns a random number that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.\n+\n+Your game will be played by a human player. You will write a function that takes the user's choice and returns it.\n+\n+1. Create a function named `getHumanChoice`.\n+\n+1. Write the code so that `getHumanChoice` will return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.\n+\n+**Hint:** Use the [prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) method to get the user’s input.\n+\n+Your game will keep track of the player's score. You will write variables to keep track of the player's score.\n+\n+1. Create two new variables named `humanScore` and `computerScore` in the global scope.\n+\n+1. Initialize those variables with the value of `0`.\n+\n+Your game will be played round by round. You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.\n+\n+1. Create a new function named `playRound`.\n+\n+1. Define two parameters for `playRound`. Parameter one `humanChoice` and parameter two `computerChoice`. Use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments.\n+\n+1. Make your function’s `humanChoice` parameter case-insensitive so that players can input `\"rock\"`, `\"ROCK\"`, `\"RocK\"`, or other variations.\n+\n+1. Write the code for your `playRound` function that returns a string value representing the round winner.\n+\n+- If it is a tie, it should return `\"It's a tie!\"`.\n+\n+- If the player wins, it should return `\"You win! [player choice] beats [computer choice]\"`.\n+\n+- If the computer wins, it should return `\"You lose! [computer choice] beats [player choice]\"`.\n+\n+1. Increment the `humanScore` or `computerScore` variable based on the round winner.\n+\n+Your game will play 3 rounds. You will write a function named `playGame` that calls `playRound` to play 3 rounds, keeps track of the scores, and declares a winner at the end.\n+\n+1. Create a new function named `playGame`.\n+\n+1. Create a loop that plays 3 rounds and calls the `playRound` function each time with the human's choice and the computer's choice functions as arguments.\n+\n+1. At the end of the game, return the winner of the game based on who won the most rounds.\n+\n+- If the human player wins more rounds than the computer player, return a message that says `\"You win the game!\"`.\n+\n+- If the computer player wins more rounds than the human player, return a message that says `\"You lose the game!\"`.\n+\n+# --hints--\n+\n+You should have a function called `getComputerChoice`\n+\n+```js\n+assert.isFunction(getComputerChoice);\n+```\n+\n+Your `getComputerChoice` function should return `\"rock\"`, `\"paper\"`, or `\"scissors\"` at random.\n+\n+```js\n+const counts = {}\n+for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n+  const result = getComputerChoice();\n+  counts[result] = (counts[result] ?? 0) + 1;\n+}\n+assert.lengthOf(Object.keys(counts), 3);\n+assert.include(Object.keys(counts), \"rock\");\n+assert.include(Object.keys(counts), \"paper\"); \n+assert.include(Object.keys(counts), \"scissors\");\n+```\n+\n+You should have a function called `getHumanChoice`\n+\n+```js\n+assert.isFunction(getHumanChoice);\n+```\n+\n+You should have two variables named `humanScore` and `computerScore` in the global scope.\n+\n+```js\n+assert.exists(humanScore);\n+assert.exists(computerScore);\n+```\n+\n+You should have a function called `playRound`\n+\n+```js\n+assert.isFunction(playRound);\n+```\n+\n+Your `playRound` function should take the human and computer player choices as arguments with the parameters `humanChoice` and `computerChoice`.\n+\n+```js\n+assert.match(playRound.toString(), /\\s*(?:\\bhumanChoice\\b\\s*,\\s*\\bcomputerChoice\\b)/);\n+```\n+\n+Your `playRound` function should be case-insensitive so that players can input `\"rock\"`, `\"ROCK\"`, `\"RocK\"`, or other variations.\n+\n+```js\n+assert.match(playRound.toString(), /\\bhumanChoice\\s*\\.toLowerCase\\(\\)/);\n+```\n+\n+Your `playRound` function should return the string `\"It's a tie!\"` if the human and computer choices are the same.\n+\n+```js\n+assert.equal(playRound(\"rock\", \"rock\"), \"It's a tie!\");\n+```\n+\n+Your `playRound` function should return the string `\"You win!
