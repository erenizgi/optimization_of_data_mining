The saturation is `100%`, so the green will be fully vivid. The lightness is `50%`, so it's at its normal tone — neither too dark nor too light. As a result, the text color of the paragraph will be a bright green.\n \n One of the main advantages of the HSL color model is its intuitive nature. It makes it easy to adjust a color’s vibrancy or lightness by tweaking the saturation and lightness values without having to alter the core color (hue). \n \n For instance, if you want to create different shades or tints of the same color, you can simply adjust the lightness value.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"light\">This is a light blue div.</div>\n+<div class=\"dark\">This is a dark blue div.</div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n div.light {\n   background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 80%);\n }\n \n div.dark {\n   background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 20%);\n+  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, both `div` elements are using the same hue (`240` degrees, which is blue), but one has a lightness of `80%` (a lighter shade of blue), and the other has a lightness of `20%` (a darker shade of blue).\n \n Just like the RGB model has an `rgba()` function to include transparency, the HSL model has an `hsla()` function.
