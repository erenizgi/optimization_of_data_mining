The great news is that the `requestAnimationFrame()` API makes it easier. \n+\n+`requestAnimationFrame()` is a method that allows you to schedule the next step of your animation before the next screen repaint, resulting in a fluid and visually appealing experience.\n+\n+The next screen repaint refers to the moment when the browser refreshes the visual display of the web page. This happens multiple times per second, typically around 60 times (or 60 frames per second) on most displays.\n+\n+To use the `requestAnimationFrame()` method, all you need to do is to call it and pass a callback function into it:\n+\n+```js\n+requestAnimationFrame(callback);\n+```\n+\n+Calling `requestAnimationFrame()` must first occur inside a function that handles the animation, such as `animate()`, along with a function to update the animation, traditionally called `update()`:\n+\n+```js\n+function animate() {\n+ // Update the animation...\n+ // for example, move an element, change a style, and more.\n+ update();\n+ // Request the next frame\n+ requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+The `update()` function is where the magic happens. Inside it, you get to change whatever you want to animate. For example, updating a style or changing the position of an element:\n+\n+```js\n+function update() {\n+ element.style.transform = `translateX(${position}px)`;\n+ position += 2;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+What finally kicks off the animation is calling `requestAnimationFrame()` and passing in the `animate` function, this time outside the `animate` function:\n+\n+```js\n+requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n+```\n+\n+The loop will continue until you stop it.\n+\n+Now, let's take a look at another example. The HTML for this example is a `div` element with the text `freeCodeCamp is Awesome`:\n+\n+```html\n+<div id=\"rect\" class=\"rect\">freeCodeCamp is Awesome</div>\n+```\n+\n+This is the CSS that makes the `div` a rectangle and hides anything that goes out of the viewport on the left or right:\n+\n+```css\n+body {\n+  overflow-x: hidden;\n+}\n+\n+.rect {\n+  display: flex;\n+  align-items: center;\n+  justify-content: center;\n+  width: 400px;\n+  height: 250px;\n+  border-radius: 5px;\n+  background-color: #1b1b32;\n+  color: #f5f6f7;\n+  font-size: 2rem;\n+  position: absolute;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This is the commented JavaScript that moves the rectangle `2px` to the right at every call of `requestAnimationFrame(animate)` with the `animate` function as a callback:\n+\n+```js\n+// reference the rectangle\n+const rect = document.getElementById(\"rect\");\n+\n+// start with a position of 0\n+let position = 0;\n+\n+function update() {\n+  // Move the rectangle 2px to the right\n+  rect.style.left = position + \"px\";\n+  position += 2;\n+\n+  // Reset the position when the rectangle reaches\n+  // the right side of the screen\n+  if (position > window.innerWidth) {\n+    // Move the rectangle just outside the left side of the screen\n+    position = -rect.offsetWidth;\n+  }\n+}\n+\n+function animate() {\n+  // Update the position\n+  update();\n+\n+  //request the next frame\n+  requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n+}\n+\n+// Start the animation\n+requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n+```\n+\n+The result in the browser will be an animated title card floating across the screen.\n \n # --questions--\n "

With WAAPI, you can work with animations more dynamically, making it easier to manipulate them.\n+\n+Let's take a look at WAAPI in more detail, so you can start working with animations directly inside your JavaScript code. At the core of WAAPI is the `Animation` constructor, which provides several instance methods and properties that allow you to dynamically animate elements.\n+\n+A significant method in the `Animation` constructor is `animate()`. It allows you to create an animation by specifying keyframes and options like duration, directions easing, and iterations.\n+\n+Here's the basic syntax of the `animate()` method:\n+\n+```js\n+element.animate(keyframes, options);\n+```\n+\n+Let's look at an example. Here's a `div` element for the HTML:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"square\" id=\"square\"></div>\n+```\n+\n+Here's the CSS that makes the `div` a square and centers everything on the page:\n+\n+```css\n+body {\n+  background: #f1f1f1;\n+  display: flex;\n+  align-items: center;\n+  justify-content: center;\n+  height: 100vh;\n+}\n+\n+.square {\n+  background: #1b1b32;\n+  width: 10rem;\n+  aspect-ratio: 1/1;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+And here's the JavaScript that uses the `animate()` method:\n+\n+```js\n+const square = document.querySelector(\"#square\");\n+\n+const animation = square.animate(\n+  [{ transform: \"translateX(0px)\" }, { transform: \"translateX(100px)\" }],\n+  {\n+    duration: 2000, // makes animation lasts 2 seconds\n+    iterations: Infinity, // loops indefinitely\n+    direction: \"alternate\", // moves back and forth\n+    easing: \"ease-in-out\" // smooth easing\n+  }\n+);\n+```\n+\n+The result in the browser will be a blue square moving back and forth horizontally.\n+\n+The instance methods of the `Animation` constructor include:\n+\n+```js\n+play()\n+pause()\n+reverse()\n+finish()\n+cancel()\n+```\n+\n+And the instance properties include:\n+\n+```md\n+playbackRate\n+currentTime\n+startTime\n+effect\n+timeline\n+playState\n+finished\n+onfinish\n+oncancel\n+```\n+\n+Let's modify the example to use the `play()`, `pause()` methods and the `onfinish` property. Here's the HTML with play and pause buttons:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"square\" id=\"square\"></div>\n+\n+<button id=\"playBtn\">Play</button>\n+<button id=\"pauseBtn\">Pause</button>\n+```\n+\n+Here's the new CSS:\n+\n+```css\n+body {\n+  background: #f1f1f1;\n+  display: flex;\n+  flex-direction: column;\n+  align-items: center;\n+  justify-content: center;\n+  height: 100vh;\n+}\n+.square {\n+  background: #1b1b32;\n+  width: 10rem;\n+  aspect-ratio: 1/1;\n+  margin-bottom: 20px;\n+}\n+button {\n+  margin: 10px;\n+  padding: 10px 20px;\n+  font-size: 16px;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+And here's the new JavaScript:\n+\n+```js\n+const square = document.querySelector(\"#square\");\n+const playBtn = document.querySelector(\"#playBtn\");\n+const pauseBtn = document.querySelector(\"#pauseBtn\");\n+\n+const animation = square.animate(\n+  [{ transform: \"translateX(0px)\" }, { transform: \"translateX(200px)\" }],\n+  {\n+    duration: 5000, // Animation lasts 5 seconds\n+    // iterations: Infinity, // Loops indefinitely\n+    direction: \"alternate\", // Moves back and forth\n+    easing: \"ease-in-out\" // Smooth easing function\n+  }\n+);\n+\n+// Set the onfinish property to log a message when the animation ends\n+animation.onfinish = () => {\n+  console.log(\"Animation finished!\");\n+};\n+\n+// Play the animation when the \"Play\" button is clicked\n+playBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n+  animation.play();\n+  console.log(\"You start the animation\");\n+});\n+\n+// Pause the animation when the \"Pause\" button is clicked\n+pauseBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n+  animation.pause();\n+  console.log(\"You pause the animation\");\n+});\n+```\n+\n+The result in the browser will show the blue box moving from left to right when the `play` button is clicked.\n+\n+WAAPI extends the capabilities of CSS animations by providing more dynamic control over animations right inside JavaScript.\n+\n+With CSS animations, you define animations declaratively using properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function`. You also have the opportunity to do the same thing using the `animate()` method of WAAPI.\n+\n+The difference is that you can control the animations you create with the `animate()` method more directly and dynamically, but with CSS animations, you need to do way more by defining custom styles and triggering them inside your JavaScript file.\n+\n+CSS animation is ideal for simple and declarative animations that run automatically. Those include hover effects, transitions or animations that don't need much interaction once triggered. If your animation needs to respond to user interactions like clicks, and scrolls, or you want the user to be able to pause, reverse, or change speed dynamically, WAAPI is the better choice. \n+\n+You can consider combining both WAAPI and CSS animations when you want the simplicity of CSS for basic setup but need to control animations at runtime.\n \n # --questions--\n "

Everything begins with a `canvas` element in HTML. This element serves as a drawing surface that you can manipulate using the instance methods and properties of the `Canvas` API.\n+\n+The `Canvas` API provides everything you need to create amazing visuals, including shapes, text, animations, and even complex games. It has interfaces like `HTMLCanvasElement`, `CanvasRenderingContext2D`, `CanvasGradient`, `CanvasPattern`, `TextMetrics` which provide methods and properties you can use to create graphics in your JavaScript file.\n+\n+Let's look at how the `Canvas` API works so you can start creating graphics with JavaScript.\n+\n+First, you need to create a `canvas` element in your HTML file:\n+\n+```html\n+<canvas id=\"my-canvas\"></canvas>\n+```\n+\n+The `canvas` element is represented by the `HTMLCanvasElement` interface, which provides methods and properties for manipulating it. Additionally, you can use methods and properties from other interfaces in the `Canvas` API.\n+\n+You can give your `canvas` a `width` and `height` inside the HTML:\n+\n+```html\n+<canvas id=\"my-canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"></canvas>\n+```\n+\n+Or you can use the `width` and `height` properties of the `HTMLCanvasElement` interface:\n+\n+```js\n+const canvas = document.getElementById(\"my-canvas\");\n+canvas.width = 400;\n+canvas.height = 400;\n+```\n+\n+For now, you can't see anything on the screen yet. After creating your `canvas` element, the next thing to do is to get access to the drawing context of the canvas with the `getContext()` method of the `HTMLCanvasElement` interface. \n+\n+The most common context is `2d`, which allows you to draw in two dimensions:\n+\n+```js\n+const canvas = document.getElementById(\"my-canvas\");\n+const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n+```\n+\n+If you log the `ctx` variable to the console, you'll see the methods and properties of `CanvasRenderingContext2D` that you can use to create shapes, colors, lines, and more, along with their default values:\n+\n+```js\n+console.log(ctx);\n+```\n+\n+Once you have the 2D context, you can start drawing on the canvas.\n+\n+The `Canvas` API provides several methods and properties for drawing shapes, lines, and text. One of those is the `fillStyle` property, which you can combine with the `fillRect()` method to draw a rectangle or square:\n+\n+```js\n+const canvas = document.getElementById(\"my-canvas\");\n+\n+const ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n+\n+// Set the background color\n+ctx.fillStyle = \"crimson\";\n+\n+// Draw a rectangle\n+ctx.fillRect(1, 1, 150, 100);\n+```\n+\n+`fillRect` takes 4 number values which represent the x axis, y axis, width, and height, respectively.\n+\n+There's something on the screen now. You can also draw text or even create an animation. Here's a canvas to represent text:\n+\n+```html\n+<canvas id=\"my-text-canvas\" width=\"300\" height=\"70\"></canvas>\n+```\n+\n+To finally draw the text, pass the text into the `fillText()` method as the first argument, followed by the values for the x and y axis:\n+\n+```js\n+const textCanvas = document.getElementById(\"my-text-canvas\");\n+\n+const textCanvasCtx = textCanvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n+\n+// Set font family and size\n+textCanvasCtx.font = \"30px Arial\";\n+\n+// Set text color\n+textCanvasCtx.fillStyle = \"crimson\";\n+\n+// Draw the text\n+textCanvasCtx.fillText(\"Hello HTML Canvas!\", 1, 50);\n+```\n+\n+The result in the browser will be the red text `Hello HTML Canvas!`.\n+\n+These's much more you can do with the `Canvas` API.

With HTML's built-in `dialog` element, you can easily create these dialogs (both modal and non-modal dialogs) in your web apps.\n+\n+A modal dialog is a type of dialog that forces the user to interact with it before they can access the rest of the application or webpage. It effectively blocks interaction with other content until the user completes an action, such as closing the dialog or submitting a form.\n+\n+In contrast, a non-modal dialog allows the user to continue interacting with other parts of the page or application even when the dialog is open.
