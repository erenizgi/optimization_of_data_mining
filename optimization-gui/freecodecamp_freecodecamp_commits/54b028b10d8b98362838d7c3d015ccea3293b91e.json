These interactions can be anything from clicking on a button or focusing an input to shaking their mobile device.\n+\n+Like all JavaScript objects, the `Event` object has a number of properties that might be helpful. The properties available depend on the event that triggered this payload.\n+\n+All `Event` objects will have the `type` property. This property reveals the type of event that triggered the payload, such as `\"keydown\"` or `\"click\"`. These values will correspond to the same values you might pass to `addEventListener()`, where you can capture and utilize the `Event` object.\n+\n+`Event` objects will always have the `target` property. The `target` property is a reference to whatever object triggered the event. Most commonly, this will be some sort of `HTMLElement` object, or the `Document` or `Window` objects. But it can also be something more specific, like an `AudioContext`.\n+\n+Events also have methods, which are functions exposed as properties on the object. One commonly used method is `preventDefault()`, which prevents the default behavior of the event when called.\n+\n+If you want to handle form submissions yourself, for example, you might call `preventDefault()` to keep the browser from trying to submit the form data as a `POST` request. You will learn more about `POST` requests in future lecture videos.\n+\n+You'll also likely run in to the `stopPropagation()` method. This method prevents the event from bubbling up or propagating to parent elements. You'll learn more about what this means in a later lecture.\n+\n+There are also a large number of properties that are specific to certain implementations of the `Event` object. For example, a `FetchEvent` will have a request property to contain the request that triggered the event. \n+\n+If you are ever unsure of what properties are available, you can log the `Event` object in question or even check the documentation.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

In your programs, you will need to have a way to listen for these events and respond to them.\n+\n+The `addEventListener()` method is used to listen for events. It takes two arguments: the event you want to listen for and a function that will be called when the event occurs.\n+\n+Here is the basic syntax:\n+\n+```js\n+element.addEventListener(\"event\", listener);\n+```\n+\n+The element is the HTML element to monitor for events, and event specifies the type of event to listen for, such as `\"click\"`.\n+\n+The listener is an object that will receive the notification when the event occurs. Most of the time, this will be a function that you define to handle the event.\n+\n+Here is an example:\n+\n+```js\n+element.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n+  // code to run when the click event occurs\n+});\n+```\n+\n+You can also choose to pass in a function reference like this:\n+\n+```js\n+function handleClick() {\n+  // code to run when the click event occurs\n+}\n+\n+element.addEventListener(\"click\", handleClick);\n+```\n+\n+Sometimes you may want to create a separate function to handle the event. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.\n+\n+The listener argument can also be `null`, or it can be an object that uses the `EventListener` interface. The `EventListener` interface defines a single method called `handleEvent()`. This method is automatically called whenever the event you're listening for occurs. Using this interface allows the same object to handle multiple events if needed.\n+\n+Most of the time, you won't need to use this interface, and you can instead pass in a function that will be called when the event occurs.\n+\n+Now, let's take a look at an example to better understand how this works:\n+\n+In this example, we have a `button` element with the id of `btn`:\n+\n+```html\n+<button id=\"btn\">Show alert</button>\n+```\n+\n+We want to listen for the `\"click\"` event on this button and show an alert when the button is clicked.\n+\n+We first need to access that `button` element in our JavaScript code.

This event is triggered when the value of an input element changes.\n+\n+Here is an example:\n+\n+```html\n+<input type=\"text\" id=\"input\" placeholder=\"Type something\" />\n+```\n+\n+We want to listen for the input event on this input element and log the value of the input to the console each time the user types something.\n+\n+We first need to access that `input` element in our JavaScript code. Then we need to add an event listener to listen for the input event and log the value of the input to the console each time the user types something:\n+\n+```js\n+const input = document.getElementById(\"input\");\n+\n+input.addEventListener(\"input\", () => {\n+  console.log(input.value);\n+});\n+```\n+\n+Here is what the console will look like when the user types something in the input field:\n+\n+```md\n+h\n+he\n+hel\n+hell\n+hello\n+```\n+\n+There are many more events that you can listen for using the `addEventListener()` method.
