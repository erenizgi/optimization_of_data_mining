Roles do not provide any functionality however. Merely giving this `div` a `role` of `button` will not make it act like a button. To make it look and behave like a button you would need to use CSS and JavaScript to get the desired result. It is always better to use the native `button` or `input` element with `type=\"button\"` instead.\n \n-Since HTML alone does not provide a way to make custom UI components like tabbed navigation (tab list) accessible, ARIA roles can be very helpful.\n-\n-Here's what a tablist could look like with the `role` attribute:\n-\n-```html\n-<div role=\"tablist\" aria-label=\"Football Match Dashboard\">\n-   <button\n-     role=\"tab\"\n-     aria-selected=\"true\"\n-     aria-controls=\"match-info-panel\"\n-     id=\"match-info-tab\">\n-       Match Info\n-   </button>\n-\n-   <button\n-     role=\"tab\"\n-     aria-selected=\"false\"\n-     aria-controls=\"player-stats-panel\"\n-     id=\"player-stats-tab\">\n-     Player Stats\n-   </button>\n-</div>\n-```\n-\n-Each tab in the tablist will have an associated tab panel that will display when its tab is selected. Each tab panel will have a `role` of `tabpanel`.\n-\n-Here's what each of those tab panels could look like:\n-\n-```html\n-<div \n-  role=\"tabpanel\"\n-  id=\"match-info-panel\" \n-  aria-labelledby=\"match-info-tab\"\n->\n-   <p>\n-     Details about the match, including date,\n-     time, venue, and current score.\n-   </p>\n-</div>\n-\n-<div\n-   role=\"tabpanel\"\n-   id=\"player-stats-panel\"\n-   aria-labelledby=\"player-stats-tab\"\n-   hidden\n->\n-   <p>\n-     Individual player statistics such as goals,\n-     assists, and minutes played.\n-   </p>\n-</div>\n-```\n-\n-ARIA state describes the current status of an element, which can change based on user interactions. An example is the `aria-expanded` attribute for collapsible sections:\n-\n-```html\n-<button aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"more-info\">\n-  More Info\n-</button>\n-\n-<div id=\"more-info\" hidden>\n-   <p>This is additional information.</p>\n-</div>\n-```\n-\n-Again, this is merely describing the state, it does not provide any functionality. You would have to use JavaScript to change the state of the attribute  when the user clicks the button.\n-\n ARIA properties provide additional details about elements. For example, the `aria-labelledby` property lets you connect an element to a specific label:\n \n ```html"
