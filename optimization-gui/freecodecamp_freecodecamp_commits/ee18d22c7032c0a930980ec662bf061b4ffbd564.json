It determines where variables can be accessed or modified. In JavaScript, understanding scope is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and bug-free code. There are three main types of scope: global scope, local scope, and block scope.\n \n Global scope is the outermost scope in a JavaScript program. Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code, including within functions and blocks. These variables are often called global variables. While global variables can be convenient, they should be used sparingly as they can lead to naming conflicts and make your code harder to maintain. Here's an example of a global variable:"
