This is where ASCII comes in. ASCII, short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard used in computers to represent text. It assigns a numeric value to each character, which is universally recognized by machines.\n+\n+In this lecture, we will explore what ASCII is, how it works, and how you can use JavaScript methods like `charCodeAt()` and `fromCharCode()` to interact with ASCII values.\n+\n+ASCII is a system for encoding characters such as letters, digits, and symbols into numerical values. Each character is mapped to a specific number.\n+\n+For example, the capital letter `A` is represented by the number `65` in ASCII, while the lowercase `a` is represented by `97`. This encoding allows computers to store and manipulate text.\n+\n+The ASCII standard covers 128 characters including:\n+\n+- Uppercase and lowercase English letters (A-Z, a-z).\n+- Numbers (0-9).  \n+- Common punctuation marks and symbols (!, @, #, and so on).\n+- Control characters (such as newline and tab).  \n+\n+In JavaScript, you can easily access the ASCII code of a character using the `charCodeAt()` method. This method is called on a string and returns the ASCII code of the character at a specified index.\n+\n+Let’s take a look at an example:\n+\n+```js\n+let letter = \"A\";\n+console.log(letter.charCodeAt(0));  // Output: 65\n+```\n+\n+In this example, `A` is the first character of the string, and calling `charCodeAt(0)` returns its ASCII value, `65`.\n+\n+You can also use this method with other characters to find their ASCII values:\n+\n+```js\n+let symbol = \"!\";\n+console.log(symbol.charCodeAt(0));  // Output: 33\n+```\n+\n+Here, the ASCII code for the exclamation mark `!` is returned as `33`.\n+\n+While `charCodeAt()` helps you retrieve the ASCII value of a character, the `fromCharCode()` method allows you to do the opposite: convert an ASCII code into its corresponding character.\n+\n+Let's see this in action:\n+\n+```js\n+let char = String.fromCharCode(65);\n+console.log(char);  // Output: A\n+```\n+\n+In this example, `fromCharCode(65)` converts the ASCII value `65` back to the character `A`.\n+\n+Another example would be converting the number `97` to its corresponding lowercase letter:\n+\n+```js\n+let char = String.fromCharCode(97);\n+console.log(char);  // Output: a\n+```\n+\n+These methods are particularly useful when you need to manipulate or compare characters based on their ASCII values.\n+\n+For instance, you might use `charCodeAt()` to check if a character is uppercase, lowercase, or a digit by comparing its ASCII value.\n+\n+On the other hand, `fromCharCode()` can be used to dynamically generate characters from their ASCII codes.\n \n # --questions--\n "

One way to achieve this is by using the `includes()` method.\n+\n+The `includes()` method is used to check if a string contains a specific substring. If the substring is found within the string, the method returns `true` otherwise, it returns `false`.\n+\n+Here's the basic syntax:\n+\n+```js\n+string.includes(searchValue);\n+```\n+\n+For the syntax, the `searchValue` is the substring you want to look for within the string. And here's a example:\n+\n+```js\n+let phrase = \"JavaScript is awesome!\";\n+let result = phrase.includes(\"awesome\");\n+\n+console.log(result);  // true\n+```\n+\n+In this example, the word `awesome` is found within the string `JavaScript is awesome!`, so the `includes()` method returns `true`.\n+\n+It's important to note that the `includes()` method is case-sensitive. This means that the exact match of the characters is required, including their case.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+```js\n+let phrase = \"JavaScript is awesome!\";\n+let result = phrase.includes(\"Awesome\");\n+\n+console.log(result);  // Output: false\n+```\n+\n+Since `Awesome` (with an uppercase `A`) does not match `awesome` (with a lowercase `a`), the result is `false`.\n+\n+You can also use the `includes()` method to check for a substring starting at a specific index in the string by providing a second parameter:\n+\n+```js\n+let text = \"Hello, JavaScript world!\";\n+let result = text.includes(\"JavaScript\", 7);\n+\n+console.log(result);  // true\n+```\n+\n+Here, the search for the substring `JavaScript` starts from the 7th position in the string, ensuring it skips any characters before this position.\n+\n+The `includes()` method only returns a `true` or `false` result. It does not provide information on where the substring is located in the string or how many times it occurs. If you need that level of detail, other methods, such as the `indexOf()` method might be more suitable.\n \n # --questions--\n "

It takes two parameters: the starting index and the optional ending index.\n+\n+Here's the basic syntax:\n+\n+```js\n+string.slice(startIndex, endIndex);\n+```\n+\n+`startIndex` is the position where the extraction starts. `endIndex` is where the extraction ends. If not provided, `slice()` extracts until the end of the string.\n+\n+Let's look at a simple example of extracting part of a string:\n+\n+```js\n+let message = \"Hello, world!\";\n+let greeting = message.slice(0, 5);\n+\n+console.log(greeting);  // Output: Hello\n+```\n+\n+In this example, `slice(0, 5)` extracts characters starting from index `0` up to but not including index `5`. As a result, the word `Hello` is extracted.\n+\n+If you omit the second parameter, `slice()` will extract everything from the start index to the end of the string:\n+\n+```js\n+let message = \"Hello, world!\";\n+let world = message.slice(7);\n+\n+console.log(world);  // Output: world!\n+```\n+\n+Here, `slice(7)` extracts the string from index `7` to the end of the string, resulting in `world!`.\n+\n+You can also use negative numbers as indexes. When you use a negative number, it counts backward from the end of the string:\n+\n+```js\n+let message = \"JavaScript is fun!\";\n+let lastWord = message.slice(-4);\n+\n+console.log(lastWord);  // Output: fun!\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `slice(-4)` extracts the last four characters from the string, giving us `fun!`.\n+\n+Let's say you want to extract a section from the middle of a string. You can provide both the starting and ending indexes to precisely control which part of the string you want:\n+\n+```js\n+let message = \"I love JavaScript!\";\n+let language = message.slice(7, 17);\n+\n+console.log(language);  // Output: JavaScript\n+```\n+\n+Here, `slice(7, 17)` extracts the substring starting at index 7 and ending right before index `17`, which is the word `JavaScript`.\n+\n+The `slice()` method is a powerful tool for extracting parts of a string in JavaScript.\n+\n+You specify the start and end indexes, and the method returns a new string that contains the extracted portion.\n+\n+With options for positive, negative, and omitted indexes, you can adapt it to various situations without altering the original string.\n \n # --questions--\n "

Whitespace can interfere with operations like comparison, storage, or display, which is why it's important to know how to remove it efficiently.\n+\n+In this lecture, we'll explore how you can trim whitespace using JavaScript's `trim()`, `trimStart()`, and `trimEnd()` methods.\n+\n+Whitespace refers to spaces, tabs, or line breaks that occur in a string but are not visible characters. For example:\n+\n+```js\n+let greeting = \"   Hello, world!   \";\n+```\n+\n+In this case, there are spaces before and after the visible text, `Hello, world!`.\n+\n+The `trim()` method is the most commonly used way to remove whitespace from both the beginning and the end of a string. Here's an example:\n+\n+```js\n+let message = \"   Hello!   \";\n+let trimmedMessage = message.trim();\n+console.log(trimmedMessage);  // Output: \"Hello!\"\n+```\n+\n+In this case, the `trim()` method removes all the leading and trailing spaces, leaving just `Hello!`. Note that any whitespace within the string (between words, for example) is left untouched by `trim()`.\n+\n+Sometimes, you may only want to remove whitespace from either the beginning or the end of a string, but not both. This is where `trimStart()` and `trimEnd()` come in.\n+\n+`trimStart()` removes whitespace from the beginning (or start) of the string.\n+\n+```js\n+let greeting = \"   Hello!   \";\n+let trimmedStart = greeting.trimStart();\n+\n+console.log(trimmedStart);  // Output: \"Hello!   \"\n+```\n+\n+`trimEnd()` removes whitespace from the end of the string.\n+\n+```js\n+let greeting = \"   Hello!   \";\n+let trimmedEnd = greeting.trimEnd();\n+\n+console.log(trimmedEnd);  // Output: \"   Hello!\"\n+```\n+\n+These methods give you more precise control over which part of the string you want to clean up.\n+\n+In summary, trimming whitespace is an essential part of working with strings in JavaScript. Whether you want to clean up input data or ensure consistent string comparisons, you can use `trim()` to remove whitespace from both sides of a string, or use `trimStart()` and `trimEnd()` to target specific sides.\n \n # --questions--\n "
