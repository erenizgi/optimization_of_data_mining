It's like making a deal where each person agrees to give up something to get something else they want. For example, if two friends want to eat out, but one wants pizza and the other wants burgers, a `compromise` might be choosing a restaurant that serves both.\n-\n-In simple work situations, `compromise` helps people work together better. Imagine two colleagues planning a presentation. One wants to use a lot of pictures, and the other prefers more words. A `compromise` might be to use some pictures and some words. This way, both ideas are used.\n-\n-`Neither` is used to deny or refute two options or possibilities.
