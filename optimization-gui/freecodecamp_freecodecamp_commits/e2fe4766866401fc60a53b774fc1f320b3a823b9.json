In some programming languages, characters surrounded by single quotes are treated differently than characters surrounded by double quotes, but in Python, they're treated equally. So, you can use either when working with strings. Here are some examples of strings:\n+\n+```python\n+my_str_1 = 'Hello'\n+my_str_2 = \"World\"\n+```\n+\n+If you need a multi-line string, you can use triple double quotes or single quotes:\n+\n+```python\n+my_str_3 = \"\"\"Multiline\n+string\"\"\"\n+my_str_4 = '''Another\n+multiline\n+string'''\n+```\n+\n+If your string contains either single or double quotation marks, then you have two options:\n+\n+- Use the opposite kind of quotes. That is, if your string contains single quotes, use double quotes to wrap the string, and vice versa:\n+    \n+\n+```python\n+msg = \"It's a sunny day\"\n+quote = 'She said, \"Hello World!\"'\n+```\n+\n+- Escape the single or double quotation mark in the string with a backslash (`\\`). With this method, you can use either single or double quotation marks to wrap the string itself:\n+    \n+\n+```python\n+msg = 'It\\'s a sunny day'\n+quote = \"She said, \\\"Hello!\\\"\"\n+```\n+\n+Sometimes, you may need to check if a string contains one or more characters. For that, Python provides the `in` operator, which returns a boolean that specifies whether the character or characters exist in the string or not.\n+\n+Here are some examples:\n+\n+```python\n+my_str = 'Hello world'\n+\n+print('Hello' in my_str)  # True\n+print('hey' in my_str)    # False\n+print('hi' in my_str)    # False\n+print('e' in my_str)  # True\n+print('f' in my_str)  # False\n+```\n+\n+Now, let's look at how you can get the length of a string and work with the individual characters in a string, a process called **indexing**. To get the length of a string, you can use the built-in `len()` function. Here's an example:\n+\n+```python\n+my_str = 'Hello world'\n+print(len(my_str))  # 11\n+```\n+\n+Each character in a string has a position called an index. The index is zero-based, meaning that the index of the first character of a string is `0`, the index of the second character is `1`, and so on. To access a character by its index, you use square brackets (`[]`) with the index of the character you want to access inside. Here are some examples:\n+\n+```python\n+my_str = \"Hello world\"\n+\n+print(my_str[0])  # H\n+print(my_str[6])  # w\n+```\n+\n+Negative indexing is also allowed, so you can get the last character of any string with `-1`, the second-to-last character with `-2`, and so on:\n+\n+```python\n+my_str = 'Hello world'\n+print(my_str[-1])  # d\n+print(my_str[-2]) # l\n+```\n+\n+Many other programming languages group data types broadly as either primitive or reference types. Primitive types are simple and immutable, meaning they can't be changed once declared. Reference types can hold multiple values, and are either mutable or immutable. But Python doesn't draw a hard line between those two groups. Instead, all data gets treated as objects, and some objects are immutable while others are mutable.\n+\n+Immutable data types can't be modified or altered once they're declared. You can point their variables at something new, which is called reassignment, but you can't change the original object itself by adding, removing, or replacing any of its elements. \n+\n+Strings are immutable data types in Python. This means that you can reassign a different string to a variable:\n+\n+```python\n+greeting = 'hi'\n+greeting = 'hello'\n+print(greeting) # hello\n+```\n+\n+But direct modification of a string isn't allowed:\n+\n+```python\n+greeting = 'hi'\n+greeting[0] = 'H' # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n+```\n+\n+Examples of other immutable data types in Python are integer, float, boolean, tuple, and range.

It allows you to handle interpolation and also do some concatenation with a compact and readable syntax.\n-\n-F-strings start with `f` (either lowercase or uppercase) before the quotes, and allow you to embed variables or expressions inside replacement fields indicated by curly braces (`{}`). Here's an example:\n-\n-```python\n-name = 'John Doe'\n-age = 26\n-name_and_age = f'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old'\n-print(name_and_age) # My name is John Doe and I am 26 years old\n-\n-num1 = 5\n-num2 = 10\n-print(f'The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}') # The sum of 5 and 10 is 15\n-```\n-\n-Now that you've learned about string concatenation and f-strings, let's look at how you can get the length of a string and work with the individual characters in a string, a process called **indexing**. To get the length of a string, you can use the built-in `len()` function. Here's an example:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(len(my_str))  # 11\n-```\n-\n-Now onto indexing. Each character in a string has a position called an index. The index is zero-based, meaning that the index of the first character of a string is `0`, the index of the second character is `1`, and so on. To access a character by its index, you use square brackets (`[]`) with the index of the character you want to access inside. Here are some examples:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = \"Hello world\"\n-\n-print(my_str[0])  # H\n-print(my_str[6])  # w\n-```\n-\n-Negative indexing is also allowed, so you can get the last character of any string with `-1`, the second-to-last character with `-2`, and so on:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(my_str[-1])  # d\n-print(my_str[-2]) # l\n-```\n-\n-Now that you're familiar with indexing, let's take things a bit further with **string slicing**. String slicing lets you extract a portion of a string or work with only a specific part of it. Here's the basic syntax:\n-\n-```python\n-string[start:stop]\n-```\n-\n-If you want to extract characters from a certain index to another, you just separate the `start` and `stop` indices with a colon:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(my_str[1:4]) # ell\n-```\n-\n-Note that the `stop` index is non-inclusive, so `[1:4]` just extracted the characters from index `1`, and up to, but not including, the character at index `4`.\n-\n-You can also omit the `start` and `stop` indices, and Python will default to `0` or the end of the string, respectively. For example, here's what happens if you omit the `start` index:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(my_str[:7])  # Hello w\n-```\n-\n-This extracts everything from index `0` up to (but not including), the character at index `7`. And here's what happens if you omit the `stop` index:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(my_str[8:])  # rld\n-```\n-\n-This extracts everything from the character at index `8` until the end of the string.\n-\n-You can also omit both the `start` and `stop` indices, which will extract the whole string:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(my_str[:])  # Hello world\n-```\n-\n-Apart from the `start` and `stop` indices, there's also an optional step parameter, which is used to specify the increment between each index in the slice.\n-\n-Here's the syntax for that:\n-\n-```python\n-string[start:stop:step]\n-```\n-\n-In the example below, the slicing starts at index `0`, stops before `11`, and extracts every second character:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(my_str[0:11:2])  # Hlowrd\n-```\n-\n-A helpful trick you can do with the `step` parameter is to reverse a string by setting step to `-1`, and leaving `start` and `stop` blank:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-print(my_str[::-1]) # dlrow olleH\n-```\n-\n-It can also be helpful to check if a character or set of characters exist in a string before slicing it. To do that, Python provides the `in` operator, which returns a boolean that specifies whether the character or characters exist in the string or not.\n-\n-Here are some examples:\n-\n-```python\n-my_str = 'Hello world'\n-\n-print('Hello' in my_str)  # True\n-print('hey' in my_str)    # False\n-print('hi' in my_str)    # False\n-print('e' in my_str)  # True\n-print('f' in my_str)  # False\n-```\n-\n-# --questions--\n-\n-## --text--\n-\n-How can you concatenate strings in Python?\n-\n-## --answers--\n-\n-By using the `+` operator or `f strings`.\n-\n----\n-\n-By using the `*` operator for joining strings.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-There's a simple operator and a special string format for this.\n-\n----\n-\n-By using the `&` operator to merge strings.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-There's a simple operator and a special string format for this.\n-\n----\n-\n-By assigning multiple strings to a list and printing them together.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-There's a simple operator and a special string format for this.\n-\n-## --video-solution--\n-\n-1\n-\n-## --text--\n-\n-How do you define a multiline string in Python?\n-\n-## --answers--\n-\n-Using parentheses `()` around the string.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-Python allows special quotes for multiline strings.\n-\n----\n-\n-Using triple double quotes `\"\"\"` or triple single quotes `'''`.\n-\n----\n-\n-Using a backslash `\\` at the end of each line.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-Python allows special quotes for multiline strings.\n-\n----\n-\n-Using square brackets `[]` to enclose the string.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-Python allows special quotes for multiline strings.\n-\n-## --video-solution--\n-\n-2\n-\n----\n-\n-## --text--\n-\n-How do you extract a specific portion of a string in Python?\n-\n-## --answers--\n-\n-Using parentheses with start and end positions.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-This operation relies on character positions and uses bracket notation.\n-\n----\n-\n-Using curly braces with start and stop positions.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-This operation relies on character positions and uses bracket notation.\n-\n----\n-\n-Using square brackets with start and stop positions.\n-\n----\n-\n-Using angle brackets with start and stop positions.\n-\n-### --feedback--\n-\n-This operation relies on character positions and uses bracket notation.\n-\n-## --video-solution--\n-\n-3"

Primitive types are simple and immutable, meaning they can't be changed once declared. Reference types can hold multiple values, and are either mutable or immutable. But Python doesn't draw a hard line between those two groups. Instead, all data gets treated as objects, and some objects are immutable while others are mutable.\n-\n-Immutable data types can't be modified or altered once they're declared. You can point their variables at something new, which is called reassignment, but you can't change the original object itself by adding, removing, or replacing any of its elements. Examples of immutable data types in Python are string, integer, float, boolean, tuple, and range.\n-\n-Here's an example showing that, while you can reassign a different string to a variable, direct modification of a string isn't allowed because strings are immutable:\n-\n-```python\n-greeting = 'hi'\n-greeting = 'hello'\n-print(greeting) # hello\n-\n-greeting[0] = 'H' # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n-```\n-\n-On the other hand, you can change mutable types without giving them a new name. You can add, remove, or update items right where they live. Examples are a list and a dictionary.\n-\n-Here's an example of updating an element in a list:\n-\n-```python\n-nums = [1, 2, 3]\n-nums[0] = 4\n-\n-print(nums) # [4, 2, 3]\n-```\n-\n To get the data type of a variable, you can use the `type()` function:\n \n ```python\n@@ -157,42 +125,37 @@ And here's are all the data types covered in this lesson, along with their types\n \n ```python\n my_integer_var = 10\n-print('Integer:', my_integer_var, '| Type:', type(my_integer_var))  # Integer: 10 | Type: <class 'int'>\n+print(type(my_integer_var))  # <class 'int'>\n \n my_float_var = 4.50\n-print('Float:', my_float_var, '| Type:', type(my_float_var))  # Float: 4.5 | Type: <class 'float'>\n-\n-my_complex_var = 3 + 4j\n-print('Complex:', my_complex_var, '| Type:', type(my_complex_var))  # Complex: (3+4j) | Type: <class 'complex'>\n+print(type(my_float_var))  # <class 'float'>\n \n my_string_var = 'hello'\n-print('String:', my_string_var, '| Type:', type(my_string_var))  # String: hello | Type: <class 'str'>\n+print(type(my_string_var))  # <class 'str'>\n \n my_boolean_var = True\n-print('Boolean:', my_boolean_var, '| Type:', type(my_boolean_var))  # Boolean: True | Type: <class 'bool'>\n+print(type(my_boolean_var))  # <class 'bool'>\n \n my_set_var = {7, 5, 8}\n-print('Set:', my_set_var, '| Type:', type(my_set_var))  # Set: {7, 5, 8} | Type: <class 'set'>\n+print(type(my_set_var))  # <class 'set'>\n \n my_dictionary_var = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}\n-print('Dictionary:', my_dictionary_var, '| Type:', type(my_dictionary_var))  # Dictionary: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25} | Type: <class 'dict'>\n+print(type(my_dictionary_var))  # <class 'dict'>\n \n my_tuple_var = (7, 5, 8)\n-print('Tuple:', my_tuple_var, '| Type:', type(my_tuple_var))  # Tuple: (7, 5, 8) | Type: <class 'tuple'>\n+print(type(my_tuple_var))  # <class 'tuple'>\n \n my_range_var = range(5)\n-print('Range:', list(my_range_var), '| Type:', type(my_range_var))  # Range: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] | Type: <class 'range'>\n+print(type(my_range_var))  # <class 'range'>\n \n my_list = [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True]\n-print('List:', list(my_list), '| Type:', type(my_list)) # List: [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True] | Type: <class 'list'>\n+print(type(my_list)) # <class 'list'>\n \n my_none_var = None\n-print('None:', my_none_var, '| Type:', type(my_none_var))  # None: None | Type: <class 'NoneType'>\n+print(type(my_none_var))  # <class 'NoneType'>\n ```\n \n-Another way to check the type of a variable is to use the built-in `isinstance()` function, which checks if a variable matches a specific data type.\n-\n-`isinstance()` takes in an object and the type you want to check it against, then returns a boolean. Here are some examples:\n+The built-in `isinstance()` function lets you  check if a variable matches a specific data type. It takes in an object and the type you want to check it against, then returns a boolean. Here are some examples:\n \n ```python\n isinstance('Hello world', str) # True\n@@ -201,34 +164,6 @@ isinstance(42, int) # True\n isinstance('John Doe', int) # False\n ```\n \n-Although Python is dynamically typed, you can still add type hints. These are optional signals that tell other developers what the data type of a variable or function is expected to be. Here's a quick example for variable types:\n-\n-```python\n-user_name: str = 'John Doe'\n-user_age: int = 24\n-```\n-\n-Here's another example showing hints for function parameters and a return type:\n-\n-```python\n-def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:\n-    return f'Hello, {name}, age {age}.'\n-```\n-\n-And here's a combination of the two:\n-\n-```python\n-def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:\n-    return f'Hello, {name}, age {age}.'\n-\n-user_name: str = 'John Doe'\n-user_age: int = 24\n-\n-print(greet(user_name, user_age)) # Hello, John Doe, age 24.\n-```\n-\n-Note that, unlike TypeScript which enforces types at compile time, Python just uses these hints for static analysis, documentation, and editor support, **not** for enforcing types during runtime. This can help developers catch bugs early and improve code readability, especially in large projects.\n-\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--",
