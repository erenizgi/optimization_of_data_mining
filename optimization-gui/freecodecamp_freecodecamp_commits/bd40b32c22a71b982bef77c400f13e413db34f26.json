Let's look at some common unary operators and how they work.\n \n The unary plus operator converts its operand into a number. If the operand is already a number, it remains unchanged.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const str = '42';\n const strToNum = +str;\n@@ -20,8 +22,12 @@ console.log(typeof str); // string\n console.log(typeof strToNum); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Unary plus is handy when you want to make sure you're working with a numeric value. As you might guess, there's a unary negation operator. It negates the value of the operand. It works similarly to the unary plus, except it flips the sign.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const str = '42';\n const strToNegativeNum = -str;\n@@ -31,8 +37,12 @@ console.log(typeof str); // string\n console.log(typeof strToNegativeNum); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The logical NOT operator, represented by an exclamation mark (`!`), is another unary operator. It flips the boolean value of its operand. So, if the operand is `true`, it becomes `false`, and if it's `false`, it becomes `true`. \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let isOnline = true;\n console.log(!isOnline); // false\n@@ -41,24 +51,34 @@ let isOffline = false;\n console.log(!isOffline); // true\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The bitwise NOT operator is a less commonly used unary operator. Represented by a tilde, `~`, it inverts the binary representation of a number. Computers store numbers in binary format (1s and 0s). The `~` operator flips every bit, meaning it changes all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s. You will learn more about binary and bits in a future lesson.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const num = 5; // The binary for 5 is 00000101\n \n console.log(~num); // -6\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, `5` became `-6` because by applying the `~` operator to `5`, you get `- (5 + 1)`, which equals `-6` due to two's complement representation. Two's complement is a way computers represent negative numbers in binary. You probably won't use the bitwise NOT often unless you're working with low-level programming tasks like manipulating bits directly.\n \n The `void` keyword is a unary operator that evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = void (2 + 2);\n \n console.log(result); // undefined\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `void` is also commonly used in hyperlinks to prevent navigation:\n \n ```js\n@@ -67,12 +87,16 @@ console.log(result); // undefined\n \n Finally, there is the `typeof` operator which you learned about in previous lessons.
