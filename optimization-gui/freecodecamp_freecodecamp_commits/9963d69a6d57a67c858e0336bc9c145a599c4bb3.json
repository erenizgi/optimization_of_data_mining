Instead, Python automatically calls them when certain actions happen. These operations include:\n+\n+  - **arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and others**. In addition, `__add__()` is called, `__sub__()` for subtraction, `__mul__()` for multiplication, and `__truediv__()` for division.\n+        \n+  - **string operations like concatenation, repetition, formatting, and conversion to text**. `__add__()` is called for concatenation, `__mul__()` for repetition, `__format__()` for formatting, `__str__()` and `__repr__()` for text conversion, and so on.\n+        \n+  - **comparison operations like equality, less-than, greater-than, and others**. `__eq__()` is called for equality checks, `__lt__()` for less-than, `__gt__()` for greater-than, and so on.\n+        \n+  - **iteration operations like making an object iterable and advancing through items**. `__iter__()` is called to return an iterator and  `__next__()` to fetch the next item.\n+\n+## Real World Example: Shopping Cart\n+\n+- **Cart Class with Dunder Methods**: Allows adding, removing, iterating, and checking contents with built-in behavior.\n+\n+```python\n+class Cart:\n+    def __init__(self):\n+        self.items = []\n+\n+    def add(self, item):\n+        self.items.append(item)\n+\n+    def remove(self, item):\n+        if item in self.items:\n+            self.items.remove(item)\n+        else:\n+            print(f'{item} is not in cart')\n+\n+    def list_items(self):\n+        return self.items\n+\n+    def __len__(self):\n+        return len(self.items)\n+\n+    def __getitem__(self, index):\n+        return self.items[index]\n+\n+    def __contains__(self, item):\n+        return item in self.items\n+\n+    def __iter__(self):\n+        return iter(self.items)\n+\n+cart = Cart()\n+cart.add('Laptop')\n+print(len(cart))        # 1\n+print('Laptop' in cart) # True\n+```\n \n # --assignment--\n "
