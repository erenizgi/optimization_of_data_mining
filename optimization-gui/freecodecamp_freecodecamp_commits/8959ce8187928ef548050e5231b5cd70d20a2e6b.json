It's the type of pop-up that a website might show you on top of their content. HTML has a `dialog` element that you can use to create modals.\n \n The content behind a modal is usually dimmed. This helps the user visually focus on the area you want them to interact with – in this case, the modal.\n \n It's always a good idea to allow the user to click outside of the modal to close it.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<button id=\"open-modal\">Open Modal</button>\n+<dialog>\n+  <h2>Subscribe to our Newsletter!</h2>\n+  <p>Get the latest updates and offers.</p>\n+  <button>Subscribe</button>\n+  <button>Close</button>\n+</dialog>\n+\n+<script src=\"index.js\"></script>\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+dialog {\n+  border: none;\n+  border-radius: 8px;\n+  padding: 20px;\n+  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n+}\n+\n+body::backdrop {\n+  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```js\n+const dialog = document.querySelector('dialog');\n+const closeButton = dialog.querySelector('button:last-of-type');\n+const openModalButton = document.getElementById('open-modal');\n+\n+closeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n+  dialog.close();\n+});\n+\n+openModalButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n+  dialog.showModal();\n+});\n+\n+// Close the modal when clicking outside of it\n+dialog.addEventListener('click', (event) => {\n+  const rect = dialog.getBoundingClientRect();\n+  const isInDialog = (\n+    event.clientX >= rect.left &&\n+    event.clientX <= rect.right &&\n+    event.clientY >= rect.top &&\n+    event.clientY <= rect.bottom\n+  );\n+  if (!isInDialog) {\n+    dialog.close();\n+  }\n+}); \n+\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n You'll often see very prominent buttons on modals. These are called CTAs, or call-to-action. You want these to be easily identifiable since the purpose of interrupting the user's flow with a modal is to prompt them to take a specific action.\n \n Modals should also have a close button. While you may really want the user to click on your CTAs, it's important to give them an option to back out of the modal and resume whatever they were previously doing.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<button id=\"open-modal\">Open Modal</button>\n+<dialog>\n+  <h2>Subscribe to our Newsletter!</h2>\n+  <p>Get the latest updates and offers.</p>\n+  <button class=\"cta\">Subscribe</button>\n+  <button class=\"close\">Close</button>\n+</dialog>\n+<script src=\"index.js\"></script>\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+.cta {\n+  background-color: #007BFF;\n+  color: white;\n+  border: none;\n+  padding: 10px 20px;\n+  border-radius: 4px;\n+  cursor: pointer;\n+}\n+\n+.close {\n+  background-color: transparent;\n+  color: #007BFF;\n+  border: none;\n+  padding: 10px 20px;\n+  cursor: pointer;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```js\n+const dialog = document.querySelector('dialog');\n+const closeButton = dialog.querySelector('.close');\n+const openModalButton = document.getElementById('open-modal');\n+\n+closeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n+  dialog.close();\n+});\n+\n+openModalButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n+  dialog.showModal();\n+});\n+\n+// Close the modal when clicking outside of it\n+dialog.addEventListener('click', (event) => {\n+  const rect = dialog.getBoundingClientRect();\n+  const isInDialog = (\n+    event.clientX >= rect.left &&\n+    event.clientX <= rect.right &&\n+    event.clientY >= rect.top &&\n+    event.clientY <= rect.bottom\n+  );\n+  if (!isInDialog) {\n+    dialog.close();\n+  }\n+});\n+\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n There are, of course, accessibility concerns with modals, such as correctly managing focus on elements.
