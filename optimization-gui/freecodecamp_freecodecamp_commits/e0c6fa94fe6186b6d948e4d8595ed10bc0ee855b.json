element?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-Other elements are placed in relation to the floated element.\n+Absolute positioning is used to determine if an element needs to be moved below the floated content. \n \n ---\n \n-The surrounding elements ignore the floated element and overlap it.\n+Absolute positioning is used to position the element within the normal document flow.\n \n ---\n \n-It will shift surrounding elements behind the floated element.\n+Absolute positioning is used to control the vertical stacking order of positioned elements that overlap on the page.\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-Block elements surrounding it flow around the floated element.\n+Absolute positioning allows you to take an element out of the normal document flow, making it behave independently from other elements.\n \n ### --question--\n \n #### --text--\n \n-What does an element with `position: sticky` require for it to work?\n+Which of the following is NOT a valid property that you can use for

child element's sticky behavior is not affected by the `overflow` property of the parent.\n+Absolute positioning sets the element in a sticky position while relative positioning takes an element out of the normal document flow.\n \n ---\n \n-The sticky element will maintain its behavior regardless of scrolling.\n+Relative positioning sets the element in a fixed position while absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal document flow.\n \n ---\n \n-The sticky element will act as if it has `position: fixed` within the parent.\n+Absolute positioning positions the element within the normal document flow while relative positioning takes an element out of the normal document flow.\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-The child will lose its sticky behavior when the parent scrolls.\n+Relative positioning positions the element within the normal document flow while absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal document flow.\n \n ### --question--\n \n #### --text--\n \n-Which of the following properties is used to offset a positioned element from its normal position?\n+Which of the following is an example of positioning a box in the upper left hand corner of the page?\n \n

\n-How does a floated element impact the height of its containing block when the containing block does not have an explicit height defined?\n+Which positioning method allows an element to stick to a defined position only when you scroll past a certain point?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-The height of the containing block is automatically expanded to fit the floated element.\n+Float positioning\n \n ---\n \n-The height will automatically adapt to fit all the floated elements.\n+Fixed positioning\n \n ---\n \n-The containing block will automatically apply `clear: both` to fit the floated element.\n+Absolute positioning\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-The containing block will collapse, completely ignoring its floated element height.\n+Sticky positioning\n \n ### --question--\n \n #### --text--\n \n-Which of the following CSS techniques is an accepted method for preventing a parent container from shrinking in size when it contains only floated elements?\n+Which of the following

followed by non-floating inline elements, how will their layout be affected?\n+What is the difference between sticky and fixed positioning?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-The inline elements will be positioned below the floated element. \n+Sticky elements can only be used in table layouts while fixed elements can be used in any type of CSS layout.\n \n ---\n \n-Inline elements will always be on top of the floated element.\n+Sticky elements will always remain in the same position while fixed elements will stick to a certain point then behave like relative elements.\n \n ---\n \n-The inline elements will overlap the floated element.\n+Fixed elements will be positioned relative to its normal position while sticky elements will only stick to a certain point then behave like relative elements.\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-Inline elements will wrap around the floated element if there is enough space.\n+Fixed elements will remain in the same position on the screen while sticky elements will only stick to a certain point then behave like relative elements.\n \n ### --question--\n \n #### --text--\n \n-What happens when `clear: both` is applied to an element following two floated elements - one left and one right - in a container?\n+What problem did the `clearfix` hack solve when working with floats?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-The element will be positioned to the left of the floated elements.\n+The `clearfix` hack helped solve the issue of floated elements being removed from the normal document flow and being placed in a fixed position on the page.\n \n ---\n \n-The element will align between the two floated elements.\n+The `clearfix` hack helped solve the issue of floated elements not being responsive in mobile and tablet layouts.\n \n ---\n \n-The element will wrap around the floated elements depending on space.\n+The `clearfix` hack helped solve the issue of floated elements disappearing from the page.\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-The element will be underneath both floated elements - the float breaks.\n+The `clearfix` hack helped solve the issue of overlaps and collapsing in the layouts when multiple floated elements were stacked next to each other.\n \n ### --question--\n \n #### --text--\n \n-When does an element with `z-index: auto` create a new stacking context?\n+Which of the following is a correct example for using the `clearfix` hack?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-When combined with `position: absolute` or `position: relative`.\n+```css\n+.clearfix::before {\n+  position: fixed; \n+  top: 0; \n+  width: 100%; \n+  clear: both;\n+}\n+```\n \n ---\n \n-When its parent element has `z-index: auto` and `position: fixed`.\n+```css\n+.clearfix::after {\n+  position: relative;\n+  top: 30px;\n+  left: 30px;\n+  clear: all;\n+}\n+```\n \n ---\n \n-When it is combined with `float: left`, if two sibling elements are of the same `z-index` and absolutely positioned.\n+```css\n+.clearfix::before {\n+  top: 30px;\n+

is on top?\n+What is static positioning?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-It rearranges the sibling elements in relation to its new position.\n+This is used to remove an element from its normal flow on the page and automatically position it in the upper right hand side of the webpage.\n \n ---\n \n-Adding `z-index: auto` to the parent container.\n+This allows you to take an element out of the normal document flow, making it behave independently from other elements.\n \n ---\n \n-Using `position: relative` on the parent container.\n+This allows an element to stick to a defined position only when you scroll past a certain point.\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-The document source order (HTML position).\n+This is the normal flow for the document. Elements are positioned from top to bottom and left to right one after another.\n \n ### --question--\n \n #### --text--\n \n-In what way will the property `position: relative` exert an effect on sibling elements in regards to document flow?\n+Which of the following is an example of setting the navbar to the top of the page using fixed positioning?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-It removes the element from the normal document flow, which affects the positions of siblings.\n+```css\n+.navbar {\n+  fixed: top; \n+  top: 0; \n+  width: 100%; \n+}\n+```\n \n ---\n \n-The relative element will move by the parent's top and left properties. \n+```css\n+.navbar {\n+  upper: fixed; \n+  width: 100%; \n+}\n+```\n \n ---\n \n-It creates a new stacking context which lifts the element in relation to any siblings.\n+```css\n+.navbar {\n+  position: fixed-top; \n+  top: 0; \n+  width: 100%; \n+}\n+```\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-It allows the element to shift without affecting the document flow of sibling elements.\n+```css\n+.navbar {\n+  position: fixed; \n+  top: 0; \n+  width: 100%; \n+}\n+```\n \n ### --question--\n \n #### --text--\n \n-What happens when a `position: relative` element is nested inside of a `position: absolute` parent, with `top` and `left` values set?\n+Which of the following is a valid value to use for the `z-index` property?\n \n #### --distractors--\n \n-It moves relative to the parent element's original position.\n+`12.0`\n \n ---\n \n-It moves with respect to the absolute coordinates of the containing parent element.\n+`none`\n \n ---\n \n-It will never create a new stacking context regardless of the `z-index` value.\n+`up`\n \n #### --answer--\n \n-It ignores the positioning of the parent and moves relative to its normal position.\n+`1`\n \n ### --question--\n "
