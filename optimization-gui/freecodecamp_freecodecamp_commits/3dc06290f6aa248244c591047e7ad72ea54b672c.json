You can also control their order and orientation. Web developers use it to create responsive websites and web applications that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. We refer to flexbox as a one-dimensional layout model because it focuses on arranging elements along a single axis at a time. The axis can be either horizontal or vertical. \n \n There are two key concepts that you should know about before you start working with flexbox: flex container and flex item."

We'll cover some of the most commonly used ones: `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.\n \n Let's start with `flex-wrap`. This property determines how flex items are wrapped within a flex container to fit the available space. `flex-wrap` can take three possible values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`. `nowrap` is the default value—flex items won't be wrapped onto a new line, even if their width exceeds the container's width."

It involves formatting text and selecting appropriate fonts. In this lecture, you will learn best practices for using typography in a way that enhances readability, hierarchy, and accessibility. \n \n Let's start with readability. You should choose clear and simple fonts to make your designs easy to understand. This is particularly important for the main text of your website. Users are more likely to engage with your content if the font is easy to read. Some frequently used fonts for web development are Roboto, Open Sans, Poppins, Lato, and Barlow. But there are many to choose from and you will definitely find one that fits your needs."

Let's see how this works.\n \n Browsers are responsible for interpreting and displaying fonts on a website. When the browser has to render a font, it tries to find the font file on the user's system. But if the font is not found, it will usually fall back to a default system font. This ensures that the content is still readable, even if the specific font that should be rendered on the website is missing."
