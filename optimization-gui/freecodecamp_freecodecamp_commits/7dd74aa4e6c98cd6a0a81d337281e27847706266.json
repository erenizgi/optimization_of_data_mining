The word `did` helps to turn a statement into a question. For example:\n+\n+- `You worked on the project.` - This is a statement in the past tense. The verb `worked` shows the action happened in the past.\n+\n+- `Did you work on the project?` - This is a question. Here, `did` is added at the beginning, and the main verb `work` stays in the base form.\n \n # --fillInTheBlank--\n \n ## --sentence--\n \n-`That's interesting!
