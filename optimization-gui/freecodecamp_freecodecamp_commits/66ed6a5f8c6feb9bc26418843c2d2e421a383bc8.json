While the tree data structure can have any number of branches at a single node, a binary tree can only have two branches for every node. Furthermore, a binary search tree is ordered with respect to the child subtrees, such that the value of each node in the left subtree is less than or equal to the value of the parent node, and the value of each node in the right subtree is greater than or equal to the value of the parent node. It's very helpful to visualize this relationship in order to understand it better:\n \n-<div style='width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;'><img alt=\"an example of a binairy search tree\" style='width: 100%; max-width: 350px; background-color: var(--gray-05);' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18563015/32136009-1e665d98-bbd6-11e7-9133-63184f9f9182.png'></div>\n+<div style='width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;'><img alt=\"an example of a binary search tree\" style='width: 100%; max-width: 350px; background-color: var(--gray-05);' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18563015/32136009-1e665d98-bbd6-11e7-9133-63184f9f9182.png'></div>\n \n Now this ordered relationship is very easy to see. Note that every value to the left of 8, the root node, is less than 8, and every value to the right is greater than 8. Also notice that this relationship applies to each of the subtrees as well. For example, the first left child is a subtree. 3 is the parent node, and it has exactly two child nodes — by the rules governing binary search trees, we know without even looking that the left child of this node (and any of its children) will be less than 3, and the right child (and any of its children) will be greater than 3 (but also less than the structure's root value), and so on.\n "

For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30°$, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder.
