Common eye colors are `black`, `brown`, `blue`, and `green`. Depending on the color if can have a tendency to `white` or to `black` (the color itself is stronger or weaker). In this case, you can add the words `light` (tending to `white`) and `dark` (tending to `black`) before the color to express it. Another characteristic that you normally use to identify another person's eyes is the shape - `round` when it is more like a circle and `narrow` when it is more similar to a line. Finally, you can refer to them in terms of their size, `large` (when they are big) or `small` (when they are not). Tom also expresses an opinion, saying Lisa's eyes are full of energy and vitality. In this case, you say one's eyes is `bright`.\n+\n+As you do with `hair`, the adjectives to identify a person's eyes also follow an order in English. First, you express this opinion, then move on to the size, then the shape and finally the color (preceded or not by `light` or `dark`).\n+\n+Example: `Tom has beautiful, small, narrow, light green eyes.`\n+\n+Now listen and fill in the blanks with Tom's description of Lisa's eyes.\n+\n+# --fillInTheBlank--\n+\n+## --sentence--\n+\n+`She's a colleague with long wavy brown hair and _ _ eyes.`\n+\n+## --blanks--\n+\n+`bright`\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Tom expresses an opinion first.

In it, Brian gave Maria a `timeline`. A `timeline` is a list of events in the order they happen. For example, you can make a `timeline` of your day, starting with the moment when you wake up and ending with the moment when you go to sleep. It helps you see what happens first, next, and last. In projects, it is important to have a `timeline` to understand when and in what sequence certain tasks happen.\n+\n+`To match` means that one piece of information is the same as another piece of information. If two things `don't match`, they are not the same. For example, if your friend's name is spelled differently on two lists, his name on the first list `doesn't match` his name on the second. It means they are different from each other.\n+\n+The `documentation` of a project is a collection of papers or files that give important information about it. It includes details like what the project is about, the steps to complete it, and any rules or guidelines to follow. It helps everyone involved in the project understand what to do and how to do it.\n+\n+# --question--\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What is the odd thing in the project details Maria mentions?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+The project is too expensive\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Money is not mentioned in her comment.\n+\n+---\n+\n+The times Brian mentioned in a previous conversation are different from what is in the documentation\n+\n+---\n+\n+There are not enough people and too many tasks\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+She doesn't comment about the allocation of people to the tasks.\n+\n+---\n+\n+The team will only be able to wake up, work, and sleep every day during the project\n+\n+### --feedback--\n+\n+Waking up and sleeping were only mentioned as examples.
