I am going to look at the Content Division Element - or in other words, the *div*:\n+The `div` element is used as a container to group other elements. \n \n-```html\n-<div></div>\n-```\n-\n-I like to think of the `div` as a beautiful being that can be anything you want it to be. We can give a `div` a `height`, we can give it a `width`, and we can give it a background color using CSS - or in other words styling, which we will cover in lessons coming up.\n+Here is an example of a `div` element. Add another paragraph element inside of the `div` element and see the changes in the preview window.\n \n-We can also use it in a very basic form without styling, to hold other elements together. So for example, we can create a `div` and put a heading in it, and put a paragraph in it, and now these two elements will be grouped together:\n+:::interactive_editor\n \n ```html\n <div>\n-  <h1>I am a heading</h1>\n-  <p>I am a paragraph</p>\n+  <p>Example paragraph element.</p>\n+\n </div>\n ```\n \n-Just be aware that there might be better elements to use when grouping these together. You might choose a `section` element, for example:\n+:::\n+\n+You will mainly use the `div` element when you want to group HTML elements that will share a set of CSS styles. You will learn more about CSS in future lessons and workshops. \n+\n+Even though the `div` element is commonly used in real world codebases, you should be careful not to overuse it. There are times when another element would be more appropriate. \n+\n+For example, if you wanted divide up your content into sections, then the `section` element would be more appropriate than a `div` element. \n+\n+Add another `section` element below the first one. Then inside of the `section` element, a `h2` and `p` elements. You can use whatever text you like and you will see the changes in the preview window.\n+\n+:::interactive_editor\n \n ```html\n <section>\n-  <h1>I am a heading</h1>\n-  <p>I am a paragraph</p>\n+  <h2>Mammals</h2>\n+  <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair. Most give birth to live young.</p>\n+  <ul>\n+    <li>Lion</li>\n+    <li>Elephant</li>\n+    <li>Dolphin</li>\n+  </ul>\n </section>\n ```\n \n-This is because the `section` element has semantic meaning. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a `section` element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it. \n+:::\n \n-We will dive into this topic further later on. For now, just know that the `div`, does not have this. It's like a mysterious ghost. Let's see what else we can do to a `div`, in the next lesson.\n+The `section` element has semantic meaning over the `div` element which is not semantic. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a `section` element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it. \n \n # --questions--\n "
