Data types help the program understand the kind of data it's working with, whether it's a number, text, or something else.\n+\n+JavaScript has several basic data types that you'll use in your programs. We'll explore each data type in greater detail in future lecture videos. For now, here is a brief introduction of the different data types in JavaScript.\n+\n+The first data type we will look at is the `Number` type.\n+\n+A `Number` represents both integers and floating-point values. Examples of integers include `7`, `19`, and `90`. Examples of floating point numbers include `3.14` and `5.2`. A floating point number is a number with a decimal point.\n+\n+The next data type is a `String`.\n+\n+A `String` is a sequence of characters, or text, enclosed in quotes. Here are two examples:\n+\n+```js\n+\"Hello, world\"\n+```\n+\n+```js\n+'JavaScript'\n+```\n+\n+Another data type used in JavaScript is the `Boolean` type.\n+\n+A `Boolean` represents one of two possible values: `true` or `false`. You can use a boolean to check if a page is loading, or if a user is logged in or not.\n+\n+The next two data types used in JavaScript are `undefined` and `null`.\n+\n+`undefined` means a variable has been declared but hasn't been given a value yet. `null` means the variable has been intentionally set to \"nothing\" and does not hold any value. We will explore more on how this works in future lectures.\n+\n+The next data type we will look at is the `Object` type.\n+\n+An `Object` is a more complex data type that can hold collections of key-value pairs. Let's break this down. The key (also called a property name), is like a label for the data, whereas the value, is the actual data you want to store. Here is an example:\n+\n+```js\n+let book = {\n+  title: \"The Great Gatsby\",\n+  author: \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\",\n+  year: 1925\n+};\n+```\n+\n+In this object, `title`, `author`, and `year` are the keys (or property names). `The Great Gatsby`, `F. Scott Fitzgerald`, and `1925` are the corresponding values.\n+\n+Each key-value pair in an object is called a property. So we can say that this book object has three properties. This is just a basic introduction to objects and their properties. In future videos, we'll go deeper into more advanced concepts.\n+\n+The last two data types are the `Symbol` and `BigInt` data types.\n+\n+A `Symbol` is a special type of value in JavaScript that is always unique and cannot be changed. It's often used to create unique labels or identifiers for properties:\n+\n+```js\n+// Creating two symbols\n+const symbol1 = Symbol('mySymbol');\n+const symbol2 = Symbol('mySymbol');\n+console.log(symbol1 === symbol2); // Outputs: false\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we create two symbols with the same description, but they are unique.\n+\n+`BigInt` is used for very large numbers that exceed the limit of the `Number` type:\n+\n+```js\n+const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;\n+console.log(bigNumber);\n+// Outputs: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we create a `BigInt` by adding `n` at the end of a very large number.\n+\n+Understanding these data types helps you handle and work with various kinds of data in your programs, as each type has its own characteristics and behaviors.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

With variables, you can keep track of things like numbers or text and refer to these values whenever you need them in your program.\n+\n+One way to declare a variable in JavaScript, is to use the `let` keyword. You will learn more about the `let` keyword as well as other ways to declare variables in future lectures.\n+\n+Here's an example of using `let` to declare a variable called `age`:\n+\n+```js\n+let age;\n+```\n+\n+Right now, the `age` variable does not have a value assigned to it. To assign a value to a variable you will need to use the assignment operator like this:\n+\n+```js\n+let age = 25;\n+```\n+\n+The assignment operator looks like an equals sign (`=`) but it doesn't check for equality. You'll learn about the correct operators for checking equality in future videos.\n+\n+The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. This process of assigning a value to a variable is known as initialization.\n+\n+One advantage of using the `let` keyword to declare variables is that you can reassign values to them. In programming, reassignment means giving a new value to a variable that already has one.\n+\n+Here is an example of reassigning the value for the `age` variable:\n+\n+```js\n+age = 30;\n+```\n+\n+Now the `age` variable holds the value of `30`. Notice that the `let` keyword wasn't needed again because the `age` variable was already declared, so there's no need to declare it a second time.\n+\n+When using reassignment, you only need to reference the variable name. Reassignment is useful because it allows you to update and change the value stored in a variable as your program runs. A good example of this would be updating points in a game.\n+\n+Naming variables may seem straightforward, but there are some rules and best practices to ensure your code is readable and functional.\n+\n+Your variable names should describe what the data represents. For example, instead of using a name like `x`, a more descriptive name such as `age` or `points` makes your code easier to understand.\n+\n+Variables in JavaScript must begin with a letter, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`). They cannot start with a number.\n+\n+Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning the word `age` in all lowercase and the word `Age` with a capital `A` are considered different variables.\n+\n+This is why it's important to stick with a consistent naming convention like camelCase. camelCase is where the first word is all lowercase and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.\n+\n+Here is an example of using the camelCase naming convention for a variable:\n+\n+```js\n+let thisIsCamelCase;\n+```\n+\n+There are certain keywords in JavaScript that you cannot use as variable names, such as `let`, `const`, `function`, or `return`, as they are reserved for the language itself.\n+\n+You should also avoid using special characters like exclamation points (`!`) or at (`@`) symbols, in your variable names. It is best to keep variable names readable by using letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.\n+\n+By following these guidelines, your code will be cleaner and more manageable as it grows in complexity.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

This is helpful when you want to build upon a string by adding more text to it over time.\n+\n+Here's an example of appending one string to another using the `+=` operator:\n+\n+```js\n+let greeting = 'Hello';\n+greeting += ', John!';\n+\n+// greeting is now the string Hello, John!\n+```\n+\n+It is important to remember that strings are immutable which means once a string is created you can not alter it.\n+\n+In this case, the original string of `Hello` is not modified. Instead, greeting now references the new string of `Hello, John!`\n+\n+Another way you can concatenate strings is to use the `concat()` method.\n+\n+Before we begin learning about the `concat()` method, it is important to first understand what a method and a function are at a higher level.\n+\n+In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can be called with various inputs. A method, on the other hand, is a type of function that is associated with an object, meaning it operates on the data contained within that object.\n+\n+In future lecture videos, we will dive much deeper into how functions, objects, and methods work in JavaScript. But for now, it is important to understand that JavaScript has dozens of methods you can use, like the `concat()` method.\n+\n+Here's an example of using the `concat()` method to join two strings together:\n+\n+```js\n+let str1 = 'Hello';\n+let str2 = 'World';\n+\n+let result = str1.concat(' ', str2); // Hello World\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we use the `concat()` method to join `str1`, a space (`' '`), and `str2` into a single string.\n+\n+To conclude, `+` operator is best for simple concatenation, especially when you need to combine a few strings or variables.\n+\n+The `+=` operator is useful when building up a string step by step or appending new content to an existing string variable.\n+\n+Finally, the `concat()` method is beneficial when you need to concatenate multiple strings together.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

They are there solely for the benefit of people reading the code, whether that's you or someone else.\n+\n+JavaScript provides two ways to add comments to your code: single-line comments and multi-line comments.\n+\n+Single-line comments are created using two forward slashes (`//`). Here is an example:\n+\n+```js\n+// I am a single line comment in JavaScript\n+```\n+\n+This type of comment is great for brief explanations or clarifications.\n+\n+Here is a real world example from the freeCodeCamp curriculum project files:\n+\n+```js\n+// This is to allow English to build without having to download the i18n files.\n+// It fails when trying to resolve the i18n-curriculum path if they don't exist.\n+const curriculumLocale = process.env.CURRICULUM_LOCALE ??

This comment provides important context for why this code exists.\n+\n+Comments like this are important for those working on teams for two reasons:\n+\n+1. Other developers working on the project will understand the purpose of this code.\n+\n+1. It helps prevent unnecessary changes or deletions without consulting the team, which could lead to bugs or issues.\n+\n+Another type of comment is multi-line comments. Here is the basic syntax:\n+\n+```js\n+/*\n+ I am a multiline comment.\n+ This is helpful for longer explanations.\n+*/\n+```\n+\n+Multi-line comments are useful when you need to write longer descriptions, explanations, or notes in your code.\n+\n+Let's take another look at the freeCodeCamp curriculum project files to see how multiline comments can be used in the real world.\n+\n+```js\n+/* Since there can be more than one way to complete a certification (using the\n+legacy curriculum or the new one, for instance), we need a certification\n+field to track which certification this belongs to. */\n+const dupeCertifications = [\n+  {\n+    certification: 'responsive-web-design',\n+    dupe: '2022/responsive-web-design'\n+  }\n+];\n+const hasDupe = dupeCertifications.find(\n+  cert => cert.dupe === meta.superBlock\n+);\n+```\n+\n+Just like before, ignore all of the JavaScript code because it uses concepts that haven't been taught yet. Instead, focus on the comment left by the developer.\n+\n+A developer on the team, or even a new contributor working on the project, can understand why this piece of code is here and have the full context before working on this area of the project.\n+\n+While comments are useful in programming, it is important to avoid over-commenting. You don't need to comment on every single line of code, especially if the code is straightforward and self-explanatory.\n+\n+Here is an example of using comments to explain the obvious:\n+\n+```js\n+// This code uses the const keyword to create a new variable called price.\n+// We are assigning the number 10 to the price variable.\n+const price = 10;\n+```\n+\n+In this situation, there is no need to add any comments here because the code is self-explanatory. The goal is to enhance readability, not clutter the code with unnecessary explanations.\n+\n+If you want to add comments to your personal projects as you are learning to code, that is fine. But once you start working on real world projects with other developers, it is important not to use comments for code that is self-explanatory.\n+\n+It is also important not to use comments to help explain away confusing, overly complicated, or poorly written code. In those situations, it is best to refactor, or change, your code so other developers will better understand what is going on.\n+\n+Comments are powerful tools for documenting your code and making it easier to understand. You should use comments to provide context or leave notes for yourself and others.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"
