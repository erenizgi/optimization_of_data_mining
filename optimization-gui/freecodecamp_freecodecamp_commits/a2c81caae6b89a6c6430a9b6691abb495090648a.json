It uses a predictable pattern with actions, reducers, and middleware. Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to the Redux store, often triggered by user interactions. Reducers are functions that specify how the state should change in response to those actions, ensuring the state is updated in an immutable way. Middleware, on the other hand, acts as a bridge between the action dispatching and the reducer, allowing you to extend Redux's functionality (e.g., logging, handling async operations) without modifying the core flow.\n \n-- **Zustand**: This state management solution is ideal for small to medium-scale applications. It works by using a `useStore` hook to access access state directly in components and pages. This lets you modify and access data without needing actions, reducers, or a provider.\n+- **Zustand**: This state management solution is ideal for small to medium-scale applications.
