It signals to the user that they must fill out the field to submit the form.\n+- **`:optional` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class applies styles input elements that are not required and can be left empty.\n+- **`:autofill` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class applies styles to input fields that the browser automatically fills with saved data.\n+\n+## Location Pseudo-classes\n+\n+- **Location Pseudo-classes**: These pseudo-classes are used for styling links and elements that are targeted within the current document.\n+- **`:any-link` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is a combination of the :link and :visited pseudo-classes. So, it matches any anchor element with an href attribute, regardless of whether it’s visited or not.\n+- **`:link` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class allows you to target all unvisited links on a webpage. You can use it to style links differently before the user clicks on them.\n+- **`:local-link` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class targets links that point to the same document. It can be useful when you want to differentiate internal links from external ones.\n+- **`:visited` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class targets a link the user has visited. \n+- **`:target` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is used to apply styles to an element that is the target of a URL fragment \n+\n+## Tree-structural Pseudo-classes\n+\n+- **Tree-structural Pseudo-classes**: These pseudo-classes allow you to target and style elements based on their position within the document tree. \n+- **`:root` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is usually the root `<html>` element. It helps you target the highest level in the document so you can apply a common style to the entire document.        \n+- **`:empty` Pseudo-class**: Empty elements, that is, elements with no children other than white space, are also included in the document tree. That's why there's an `:empty` pseudo-class to target empty elements.\n+- **`:nth-child(n)` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class allows you to select elements based on their position within a parent.\n+- **`:nth-last-child(n)` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class enables you to select elements by counting from the end.\n+- **`:first-child` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the first element in a parent element or the document.\n+- **`:last-child` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the last element in a parent element or the document\n+- **`:only-child` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the only element in a parent element or the document\n+- **`:first-of-type` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the first occurrence of a specific element type within its parent.\n+- **`:last-of-type` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the last occurrence of a specific element type within its parent.\n+- **`:nth-of-type(n)` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class allows you to select a specific element within its parent based on its position among siblings of the same type.\n+- **`:only-of-type` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects an element if it's the only one of its type within its parent. \n+\n+\n+## Functional Pseudo-classes\n+\n+- **Functional Pseudo-classes**: Functional pseudo-classes allow you to select elements based on more complex conditions or relationships. Unlike regular pseudo-classes which target elements based on a state (for example, :hover, :focus), functional pseudo-classes accept arguments.\n+- **`:is()` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class takes a list of selectors (ex. `ol`, `ul`) and selects an element that matches one of the selectors in the list.\n+\n+```html\n+<p class=\"example\">This text will change color.</p>\n+<p>This text will not change color.</p>\n+<p>This text will not change color.</p>\n+<p class=\"this-works-too\">This text will change color.</p>\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+p:is(.example, .this-works-too) {\n+    color: red;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+- **`:where()` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class takes a list of selectors (ex. `ol`, `ul`) and selects an element that matches one of the selectors in the list. The difference between `:is` and `:where` is that the latter will have a specificity of 0.\n+\n+```css\n+:where(h1, h2, h3) {\n+    margin: 0;\n+    padding: 0;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+- **`:has()` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is often dubbed the `\"parent\"` selector because it allows you to style elements who contain child elements specified in the selector list.\n+\n+```css\n+article:has(h2) {\n+    border: 2px solid hotpink;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Pseudo-elements \n+\n+- **`::before` Pseudo-element**: This pseudo-element uses the `content` property to insert cosmetic content like icons just before the element.\n+- **`::after` Pseudo-element**: This pseudo-element uses the `content` property to insert cosmetic content like icons just after the element.\n+- **`::first-letter` Pseudo-element**: This pseudo-element targets the first letter of an element's content, allowing you to style it.\n+- **`::marker` Pseudo-element**: This pseudo-element lets you select the marker (bullet or numbering) of list items for styling.\n \n # --assignment--\n "
