When an element is positioned absolutely, it is placed in its own layer, completely separate from everything else in the layout. This makes it useful for creating floating UI features such as modals, tooltips, or dropdown menus, which can overlap other elements on the page.\n \n By default, absolutely positioned elements are placed relative to the closest positioned ancestor. If no positioned ancestor is found, the element will be positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the browser's viewport. You can move the absolutely positioned element around using the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties to specify how far away it should be from the edges of its containing element.\n \n For example, setting `top: 30px` and `left: 30px` will move the element `30px` away from the top and left edges of the containing block. Here's an example of how to apply absolute positioning to an element in CSS:\n \n-```css\n-<body style=\"background-color: #eeeeee;\">\n-  <div class=\"positioned\">Absolutely Positioned</div>\n-</body>\n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<div class=\"positioned\">Absolutely Positioned</div>\n ```\n \n ```css\n+body {\n+  background-color: #eeeeee;\n+}\n+\n .positioned {\n   position: absolute;\n   top: 30px;\n@@ -28,6 +33,8 @@ For example, setting `top: 30px` and `left: 30px` will move the element `30px` a\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n When this code is applied, the element will be removed from the normal document flow and placed `30px` away from the top and left of its containing block.\n \n Absolute positioning can be especially helpful for creating elements that are meant to float over the rest of the content, like overlays or modal windows. However, since the element is removed from the document flow, it can also create gaps or cause other elements to collapse together if not handled properly."
