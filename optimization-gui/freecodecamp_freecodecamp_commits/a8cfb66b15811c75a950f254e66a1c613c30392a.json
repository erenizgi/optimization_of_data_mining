The collection is organized as an object that contains multiple albums which are also objects. Each album is represented in the collection with a unique `id` as the property name. Within each album object, there are various properties describing information about the album. Not all albums have complete information.\n+\n+The `updateRecords` function takes 4 arguments represented by the following function parameters:\n+\n+-   `records` - an object containing several individual albums\n+-   `id` - a number representing a specific album in the `records` object\n+-   `prop` - a string representing the name of the album’s property to update\n+-   `value` - a string containing the information used to update the album’s property\n+\n+**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.\n+\n+**User Stories:**\n+\n+1. Your function must always return the entire `records` object.\n+2. If `value` is an empty string, delete the given `prop` property from the album.\n+3. If `prop` isn't `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, assign the `value` to that album's `prop`.\n+4. If `prop` is `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, but the album doesn't have a `tracks` property, create an empty array and add `value` to it.\n+5. If prop is `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, add `value` to the end of the album's existing `tracks` array.\n+\n+**Note:** A copy of the `recordCollection` object is used for the tests.
