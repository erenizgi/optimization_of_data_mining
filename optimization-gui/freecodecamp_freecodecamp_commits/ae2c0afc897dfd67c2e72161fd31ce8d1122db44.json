It's mostly used by developers to debug and inspect code while working on their programs.\n \n You can use `console.log()` to log text or variables to the console and ensure your code is running correctly.\n \n To use `console.log()`, you call the method with the value or message you want to output inside the parentheses. Here are some examples:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(\"Hello, world!\");\n \n let num = 5;\n-console.log(num);\n+console.log(num); // 5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The first example prints `Hello, world!` in the browser's console, while the second example prints the value `5`.\n \n Here is another example of working with `console.log()`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let name = \"Alice\";\n-console.log(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!\n+console.log(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"); // Hello, Alice!\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n+You can also pass in multiple values to `console.log()` separated by commas. For example:\n+\n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```js\n+let name = \"Alice\";\n+let age = 25;\n+console.log(\"Name:\", name, \"Age:\", age); // Name: Alice Age: 25\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n+This is helpful for logging multiple pieces of information at once.\n+\n The `console.log()` method helps you monitor your code as it runs, making it easier to spot mistakes and understand how your program behaves.\n \n # --questions--\n@@ -136,7 +160,7 @@ Review the beginning of the lesson where this was discussed.\n \n ---\n \n-It is commonly used to ensure that your JavaScript code is adhering to best practices. \n+It is commonly used to ensure that your JavaScript code is adhering to best practices.\n \n ### --feedback--\n "
