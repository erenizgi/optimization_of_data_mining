Attrib\n \n The attribute name is followed by an equal sign (`=`) and a value in quotes. The value can be a string or a number, depending on the attribute.\n \n-Let's take a look at a few examples of common HTML attributes. The first example is the `href` attribute, which is used to specify the URL of a link:\n+This first example uses the `href` and `target` attributes. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of a link and the `target` attribute specifies where to open the link.\n+\n+Change the `href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/\"` to `href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org\"`. Now when you click on the link in the interactive editor, you will see the freeCodeCamp homepage in a new browser tab.\n+\n+:::interactive_editor\n \n ```html\n-<a href=\"https://www.example-website.com\">Visit our website</a>\n+<a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/\" target=\"__blank\">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>\n ```\n \n-Without this attribute, the link would not work because there would be no destination URL. So you must include this `href` attribute to make the link functional. Other common attributes are the `src`, or source, and `alt`, or alternative, attribute - which is used to specify the source of an image and provide alternative descriptive text for the image, respectively: \n+:::\n+\n+Without the `href` attribute, the link would not work because there would be no destination URL.

The `alt` attribute is not required, but it is recommended for accessibility purposes. Accessibility means making sure that everyone, including those with disabilities, can use and understand things like websites, apps, and physical spaces. You will learn more about accessibility in the upcoming lessons.\n \n-Some attributes are a little unique with their syntax like the `checked` attribute shown here:\n+Some attributes are a little unique with their syntax like the `checked` attribute.\n+\n+Try clicking on the checkbox in the preview window to see it alternate between a checked and unchecked state.\n+\n+:::interactive_editor\n \n ```html\n <input type=\"checkbox\" checked />\n ```\n \n-In the following example, we have an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `checkbox`. Inputs are used to collect data from users, and the `type` attribute specifies the type of input. In this case, this input is a checkbox. You will learn more about how inputs work in the upcoming lessons. The `checked` attribute is used to specify that the checkbox should be checked by default. The `checked` attribute does not require a value. If it is present, the checkbox will be checked by default. If the attribute is not present, the checkbox will be unchecked. This is known as a boolean attribute. You will learn more about booleans in general when you get to the JavaScript section. There are several common boolean attributes you will encounter in HTML, such as `disabled`, `readonly`, and `required`. These attributes are used to specify the state of an element, such as whether it is disabled, read-only, or required.\n+:::\n+\n+In the following example, we have an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `checkbox`.
