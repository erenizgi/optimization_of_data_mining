This is particularly useful when you're working with objects that have property names that might conflict with existing variables or when you want to use a different name:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let person = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30, city: \"New York\" };\n \n@@ -39,21 +45,29 @@ console.log(personName); // Alice\n console.log(personAge); //  30\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this case, we're extracting the `name` property and assigning it to a variable called `personName`, and doing the same with `age` and `personAge`.\n \n Object destructuring also allows you to set default values.
