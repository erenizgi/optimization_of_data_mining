In a previous lesson, you learned how to inspect and debug things using your browser’s developer tools. Those tools will be crucial for you in the following lessons. If something isn’t behaving the way you expect, inspecting it in the developer tools should be your first step every time.\n+\n+Flexbox isn’t necessarily any more difficult than the other concepts that we’ve covered so far, but it does have a few more moving parts. It is going to be somewhat difficult to make use of any of the things you’re learning in these first lessons until you get to the end and can put it all together. As we go, do yourself a favor and <strong>play with all of the code examples.</strong>\n+\n+You will almost definitely need to come back and reference these lessons (or a couple of the resources we share with you) when you get to the assignments at the end of the section, but if you take your time and experiment with all the code examples we provide, you’ll know better where to look when that time comes.\n+\n+## Let’s flex\n+\n+Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex (i.e. grow or shrink) based on some simple rules that you can define. To get started, let’s look at a simple demonstration.\n+\n+> We’ve embedded a lot of interactive examples in these lessons. Take your time to experiment with them as you go to cement the concepts in your mind!\n+\n+<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowpaymentrequest=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\"  frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" name=\"cp_embed_1\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/embed/QWgNxrp?height=400&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;slug-hash=QWgNxrp&amp;editable=true&amp;user=TheOdinProjectExamples&amp;name=cp_embed_1\" style=\"width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;\" title=\"CodePen Embed\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n+\n+We’ll get into exactly what’s going on here soon enough. But for now, let’s uncomment the two flex related CSS declarations in the above Codepen by removing the `/*` and `*/` tags surrounding them, then check out the result.\n+\n+> Comments prevent the browser from interpreting lines as code, and are wrapped between specific tags. CSS uses `/*` as an opening comment tag and `*/` as a closing comment tag, while HTML and JavaScript have their own syntax. Commented out lines of code can be re-enabled simply by removing the comment tags surrounding the code.\n+\n+All 3 divs should now be arranged horizontally. If you resize the results frame with the `1x`, `.5x` and `.25x` buttons you’ll also see that the `div` elements will \"flex\". They will fill the available area and will each have equal width.\n+\n+If you add another `div` to the HTML, inside of `.flex-container`, it will show up alongside the others, and everything will flex to fit within the available area.\n+\n+> If it’s hard to see what's going on in the small embedded CodePen, feel free to click the \"Edit on CodePen\" or \"Fork on CodePen\" button. This will bring the example into a full-sized environment. Some of the later examples might especially benefit from doing this.\n+\n+# --question--\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What happens when the two flex related CSS declarations in the CodePen are uncommented?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+The `div` elements become hidden from view, losing their visibility within the container.\n+\n+---\n+\n+All 3 `div` elements are arranged horizontally, and they flex to fill the available area with equal width.\n+\n+---\n+\n+Each `div` element enlarges and covers the entire container, overlapping each other.\n+\n+---\n+\n+The `div` elements align vertically in a single column, ignoring the flex-related CSS declarations.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2"

Try it out now (i.e. go change the flex value on the `flex: 1 1 auto;` line). Can you figure out why it does not work if `flex: 1` is used? The divs collapse, even though they clearly have a height defined there.\n+\n+The reason for this is that the flex shorthand expands `flex-basis` to `0`, which means that all `flex-growing` and `flex-shrinking` would begin their calculations from 0. Empty divs by default have 0 height, so for our flex items to fill up the height of their container, they don't actually need to have any height at all.\n+\n+The example above fixed this by specifying `flex: 1 1 auto`, telling the flex items to default to their given height. You could also have fixed it by putting a `height` on the parent `.flex-container`, or by using `flex-grow: 1` instead of the shorthand.\n+\n+Another detail to notice: when you changed the `flex-direction` to `column`, `flex-basis` refers to `height` instead of `width`. Given the context this may be obvious, but it's something to be aware of.\n+\n+# --question--\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Why does using `flex: 1` shorthand with `flex-direction: column` lead to collapsed divs in the example described?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+The `flex` shorthand defaults `flex-basis` to 0, disregarding the defined height of the divs.\n+\n+---\n+\n+The `flex` shorthand overrides the specified `flex-direction`, causing collapsing.\n+\n+---\n+\n+`flex: 1` only works in a row-based layout, not in a column-based one.\n+\n+---\n+\n+The `flex-basis` property becomes fixed to the width, ignoring the height in column layout.\n+\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+1"

Let’s say you had the following HTML:\n+\n+```html\n+<div>\n+  <div class=\"subsection header\">Latest Posts</div>\n+  <p class=\"subsection preview\">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+You have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if you only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, you could chain both the `class` selectors together in your CSS like so:\n+\n+```css\n+.subsection.header {\n+  color: red;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+What `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` and `header` classes. Notice how there isn’t any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` `class` selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one type selector.\n+\n+This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n+\n+```html\n+<div>\n+  <div class=\"subsection header\">Latest Posts</div>\n+  <p class=\"subsection\" id=\"preview\">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n+\n+```css\n+.subsection.header {\n+  color: red;\n+}\n+\n+.subsection#preview {\n+  color: blue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once.

There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we’re going to only show you the descendant combinator, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc) that matches the previous selector.\n+\n+So something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is child will only be selected if it is nested inside of `ancestor`, no matter how deep. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n+\n+```html\n+<!-- index.html -->\n+\n+<div class=\"ancestor\"> <!-- A -->\n+  <div class=\"contents\"> <!-- B -->\n+    <div class=\"contents\"> <!-- C -->\n+    </div>\n+  </div>\n+</div>\n+\n+<div class=\"contents\"></div> <!-- D -->\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+/* styles.css */\n+\n+.ancestor .contents {\n+  /* some declarations */\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (`B` and `C`) would be selected, but that last element (`D`) won’t be. Was your guess correct?\n+\n+There’s really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on.

The only thing left for now is to go over how to add all this CSS to your HTML.

The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you’ll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In the example above, you are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n+\n+Then inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, you have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a “declaration block”. Finally, you place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white;` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.\n+\n+A note on file names: `styles.css` is just what you went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though “style” or “styles” is most commonly used.\n+\n+A couple of the pros to this method are:\n+\n+1. It keeps your HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.\n+2. You only need to edit the CSS in one place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.\n+\n+# --question--\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+Which of the following best describes the purpose of the `rel` attribute in the `<link>` element when linking an external CSS file to an HTML file?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+It specifies the location of the CSS file relative to the location of the HTML file.\n+\n+---\n+\n+It specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n+\n+---\n+\n+It specifies the type of file being linked (e.g. \"stylesheet\").\n+\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2"

CSS only does what we tell it to do. One exception to this is the default styles that are provided by a browser. These default styles vary from browser to browser, and they are why some elements create a large “gap” between themselves and other elements, or why buttons look the way they do, despite us not writing any CSS rules to style them that way.\n+\n+So if you end up with some unexpected behavior like this it’s either because of these default styles, not understanding how a property works, or not understanding this little thing called the cascade.\n+\n+The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to your HTML.

These elements often look like this: `<br />` or `<img/>`, but some can also be used without the closing forward slash such as `<br>` or `<img>`.

The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\n+\n+The doctypes for older versions of HTML were a bit more complicated. For example, this is the doctype declaration for HTML4:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\n+```\n+\n+However, you probably won’t ever want to be using an older version of HTML, and so you’ll always use `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\n+\n+Open the `index.html` file created earlier in your text editor and add `<!DOCTYPE html>` to the very first line.\n+\n+# --question--\n+## --text--\n+\n+What is the purpose of the `DOCTYPE` declaration?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+It tells the browser which version of HTML to use to render the document.\n+\n+---\n+\n+It tells the browser that this document uses JavaScript.\n+\n+---\n+\n+It tells the browser the title of the document.\n+\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+1"

The programming languages and tools they use are secondary to this fundamental skill.\n+\n+From his book, \"Think Like a Programmer\", V. Anton Spraul defines problem solving in programming as:\n+\n+> Problem solving is writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints.\n+\n+The set of tasks can range from solving small coding exercises all the way up to building a social network site like Facebook or a search engine like Google. Each problem has its own set of constraints, for example, high performance and scalability may not matter too much in a coding exercise but it will be vital in apps like Google that need to service billions of search queries each day.\n+\n+New programmers often find problem solving the hardest skill to build. It's not uncommon for budding programmers to breeze through learning syntax and programming concepts, yet when trying to code something on their own, they find themselves staring blankly at their text editor not knowing where to start.\n+\n+The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by making lots and lots of programs.

If you don’t understand the problem, you won’t know when you’ve successfully solved it and may waste a lot of time on a wrong solution.\n+\n+To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps. When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.\n+\n+### Plan\n+Now that you know what you’re aiming to solve, don’t jump into coding just yet. It’s time to plan out how you’re going to solve it first. Some of the questions you should answer at this stage of the process:\n+\n+- Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.\n+\n+- What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?\n+\n+- What’s the desired output?\n+\n+- Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?\n+\n+The last question is where you will write out an algorithm to solve the problem.

The link you created to The Odin Project’s About page earlier was an absolute link as it contains the protocol and domain.\n+\n+`https://www.theodinproject.com/about`\n+\n+## Relative Links\n+Links to other pages within your own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page you created the link on.\n+\n+Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on. This is quite abstract, let’s see this in action using an example.\n+\n+Within the `odin-links-and-images` directory, create another HTML file named `about.html` and paste the following code into it:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html lang=\"en\">\n+  <head>\n+    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n+    <title>Odin Links and Images</title>\n+  </head>\n+\n+  <body>\n+    <h1>About Page</h1>\n+  </body>\n+</html>\n+```\n+\n+Back in the `index` page, add the following anchor element to create a link to the `about` page:\n+\n+```html\n+<body>\n+  <h1>Homepage</h1>\n+    <a href=\"https://www.theodinproject.com/about\">click me</a>\n+\n+    <a href=\"about.html\">About</a>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+Open the `index.html` file in a browser and click on the about link to make sure it is all wired together correctly. Clicking the link should go to the `about` page you just created.\n+\n+This works because the `index` and `about` page are in the same directory. That means you can simply use its name (`about.html`) as the link’s `href` value.\n+\n+But you will usually want to organize your website directories a little better. Normally you would only have the `index.html` at the root directory and all other HTML files in their own directory.\n+\n+Create a directory named `pages` within the `odin-links-and-images` directory and move the `about.html` file into this new directory.\n+\n+Refresh the `index` page in the browser and then click on the `about` link. It will now be broken. This is because the location of the `about` page file has changed.\n+\n+To fix this, you just need to update the `about` link `href` value to include the `pages/` directory since that is the new location of the `about.html` file relative to the `index.html` file.\n+\n+```html\n+<body>\n+  <h1>Homepage</h1>\n+  <a href=\"pages/about.html\">About</a>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+Refresh the `index` page in the browser and try clicking the `about` link again, it should now be back in working order.\n+\n+In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach. Prepending `./` before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding `./` you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the **current** directory.\n+\n+```html\n+<body>\n+  <h1>Homepage</h1>\n+  <a href=\"./pages/about.html\">About</a>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+# --assignment--\n+\n+Watch Kevin Powell’s HTML File Structure video above.\n+\n+# --question--\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What is the difference between an absolute and a relative link?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+An absolute link is a link to another page on the current website.

It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.\n+\n+For example, using an absolute path you can display an image located on The Odin Project site:\n+\n+<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowpaymentrequest=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" width=\"100%\" name=\"cp_embed_1\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/embed/gORbExZ?height=300&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;slug-hash=gORbExZ&amp;user=TheOdinProjectExamples&amp;name=cp_embed_1\" style=\"width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;\" title=\"CodePen Embed\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"cp_embed_gORbExZ\"></iframe>\n+\n+To use images that you have on your own websites, you can use a relative path.\n+\n+- Create a new directory named `images` within the `odin-links-and-images` project.\n+\n+- Next, download <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/Mv9hjnEUHR4/download?force=true&w=640\" target=\"_blank\">this image</a> and move it into the images directory you just created.\n+\n+- Rename the image to `dog.jpg`.\n+\n+Finally add the image to the `index.html` file:\n+\n+```html\n+<body>\n+  <h1>Homepage</h1>\n+    <a href=\"https://www.theodinproject.com/about\">click me</a>\n+\n+    <a href=\"pages/about.html\">About</a>\n+\n+    <img src=\"images/dog.jpg\">\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+Save the `index.html` file and open it in a browser to view Charles in all his glory.\n+\n+\n+## Parent Directories\n+\n+What if you want to use the dog image in the `about` page? You would first have to go up one level out of the pages directory into its parent directory so you could then access the images directory.\n+\n+To go to the parent directory you need to use two dots in the relative filepath like this: `../.` Let’s see this in action, within the `body` of the `about.html` file, add the following image below the heading you added earlier:\n+\n+```html\n+<img src=\"../images/dog.jpg\">\n+```\n+\n+To break this down:\n+\n+- First, you are going to the parent directory of the pages directory which is `odin-links-and-images`.\n+\n+- Then, from the parent directory, you can go into the `images` directory.\n+\n+- Finally, you can access the `dog.jpg` file.\n+\n+Using the metaphor we used earlier, using `../` in a filepath is kind of like stepping out from the room you are currently in to the main hallway so you can go to another room.\n+\n+## Alt attribute\n+\n+Besides the `src` attribute, every image element should also have an `alt` (alternative text) attribute.\n+\n+The `alt` attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.\n+\n+This is how the The Odin Project logo example you used earlier looks with an alt attribute included:\n+<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowpaymentrequest=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" width=\"100%\" name=\"cp_embed_2\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/embed/ExXjoEp?height=300&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;slug-hash=ExXjoEp&amp;user=TheOdinProjectExamples&amp;name=cp_embed_2\" style=\"width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;\" title=\"CodePen Embed\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"cp_embed_ExXjoEp\"></iframe>\n+\n+# --assignment--\n+\n+Read about the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/image-file-types-picture-format-extensions-jpeg-gif-png-svg-tiff/\" target=\"_blank\">four main image formats</a> that can be used on the web.\n+\n+# --question--\n+\n+## --text--\n+\n+What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web?\n+\n+## --answers--\n+\n+MOV, GIF, PNG, and SVG.\n+\n+---\n+\n+JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG.\n+\n+---\n+\n+JPG, PDF, SVG, and GIF.\n+\n+## --video-solution--\n+\n+2"
