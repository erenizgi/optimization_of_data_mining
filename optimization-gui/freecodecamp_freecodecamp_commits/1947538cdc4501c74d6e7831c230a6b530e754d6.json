This means that instead of writing styles as you would in a CSS file, you create a JavaScript object where the keys are camelCased versions of CSS property names, and the values are the strings of CSS values.\n+React's approach to inline styles involves using JavaScript objects to define styles, rather than traditional CSS strings.

Otherwise, passing in a name to an object would be better like in the first example.\n \n-It's important to note that while CSS property names are typically written in kebab-case (like font-size), in React's inline styles, we use camelCase (like fontSize). This is because the style object is a JavaScript object, and kebab-case names are not valid as object keys in JavaScript without using quotes.\n+It's important to note that while CSS property names are typically written in kebab case, like `font-size`, in React's inline styles, we use camel case, like `fontSize`.

They're an essential tool in a React developer's toolkit, especially for creating highly customized and interactive user interfaces.\n+In summary, inline styles in React provide a powerful way to apply and manipulate styles directly within your components.
