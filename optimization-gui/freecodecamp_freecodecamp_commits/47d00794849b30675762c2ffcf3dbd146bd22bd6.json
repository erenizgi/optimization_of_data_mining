The process involves three main steps:\n \n - Splitting the string into an array of characters.\n - Reversing the array.\n-- Joining the characters back into a string. \n+- Joining the characters back into a string.\n \n Let's explore each of these steps using the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods.\n \n@@ -25,32 +25,44 @@ The first step in reversing a string is to convert it into an array of individua\n \n Here's an example of using the split method to create an array of characters:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let str = \"hello\";\n let charArray = str.split(\"\");\n console.log(charArray); // [\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we use `split(\"\")` (with an empty string pass to it) to convert the string `hello` into an array of its individual characters. Once we have an array of characters, we can use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of elements in the array. \n \n The `reverse()` method is an array method that reverses an array in place. This means it modifies the original array rather than creating a new one. Here's how we can use it:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let charArray = [\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"];\n charArray.reverse();\n console.log(charArray); // [\"o\", \"l\", \"l\", \"e\", \"h\"]\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, `reverse()` changes the order of elements in `charArray`, reversing it from `[\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]` to `[\"o\", \"l\", \"l\", \"e\", \"h\"]`.\n \n The final step is to convert the reversed array of characters back into a string. We can accomplish this using the `join()` method. The `join()` method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array, separated by a specified separator string. If you want to join the characters without any separator, you can use an empty string as the argument. Here's an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let reversedArray = [\"o\", \"l\", \"l\", \"e\", \"h\"];\n let reversedString = reversedArray.join(\"\");\n console.log(reversedString); // \"olleh\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, `join(\"\")` (with an empty string pass to it as an argument) combines all the characters in the array into a single string without any separator between them.\n \n Remember that strings in JavaScript are immutable, which means you can't directly reverse a string by modifying it. That's why we need to convert it to an array, reverse the array, and then convert it back to a string. This combination of string and array methods provides a powerful and flexible way to manipulate strings in JavaScript."
