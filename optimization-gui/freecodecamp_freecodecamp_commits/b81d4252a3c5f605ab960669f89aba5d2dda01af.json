When the user clicks on the reset button, then it will clear out all of their input data. It is important to note that reset buttons are usually not the best idea because they could lead to users accidentally resetting their data. Also, multiple buttons in your form could clutter up the user interface.\n \n Another way to create buttons in HTML is to use the `input` element. The `input` element also has a `type` attribute with the possible values of `submit`, `reset`, and `button`. Here is an example of using the `input` element with the `type` set to `button`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```html\n-<input type=\"button\" value=\"Show Alert\" />\n+<input class=\"start-btn\" type=\"button\" value=\"Start Game\" />\n+<script src=\"index.js\"></script>\n ```\n \n+```js\n+document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\n+  const btn = document.querySelector(\".start-btn\");\n+  btn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n+    const paraEl = document.createElement(\"p\");\n+    const bodyEl = document.querySelector(\"body\");\n+\n+    bodyEl.appendChild(paraEl);\n+    paraEl.textContent = \"The game has started!!!\";\n+  });\n+});\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n The `value` attribute is used to show the button text. So, what is the difference between using the `input` and `button` elements? `input` elements are void elements, which means they cannot have child nodes, such as text, and can only have a start tag. On the other hand, the `button` element offers more flexibility because you can nest text, images, and icons inside it.\n \n # --questions--"
