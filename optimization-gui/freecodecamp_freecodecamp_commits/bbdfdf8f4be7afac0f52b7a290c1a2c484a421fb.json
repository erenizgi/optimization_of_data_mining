Examples of integers include 7, 19, and 90. \n+- **Floating point**: A floating point number is a number with a decimal point. Examples include 3.14, 0.5, and 0.0001.\n+- **String**: A string is a sequence of characters, or text, enclosed in quotes. `\"I like coding\"` and `'JavaScript is fun'` are examples of strings.\n+- **Boolean**: A boolean represents one of two possible values: `true` or `false`. You can use a boolean to represent a condition, such as `isLoggedin = true`.\n+- **Undefined and Null**: An undefined value is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. A null value is an empty value, or a variable that has intentionally been assigned a value of `null`.\n+- **Object**: An object is a collection of key-value pairs. The key is the property name, and the value is the property value.\n+\n+Here, the `pet` object has three properties or keys: `name`, `age`, and `type`. The values are `Fluffy`, `3`, and `dog`, respectively.\n+\n+```js\n+let pet = {\n+  name: 'Fluffy',\n+  age: 3,\n+  type: 'dog'\n+};\n+```\n+\n+- **Symbol**: The Symbol data type is a unique and immutable value that may be used as an identifier for object properties.\n+\n+In this example below, two symbols are created with the same description, but they are not equal.\n+\n+```js\n+const crytpicKey1= Symbol('saltNpepper');\n+const crytpicKey2= Symbol('saltNpepper');\n+console.log(crytpicKey1 === crytpicKey2); // false\n+```\n+\n+- **BigInt**: When the number is too large for the `Number` data type, you can use the BigInt data type to represent integers of arbitrary length.\n+\n+By adding an `n` to the end of the number, you can create a BigInt.\n+\n+```js\n+const veryBigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;\n+```\n+\n+## Variables in JavaScript\n+\n+- Variables can be declared using the `let` keyword. \n+\n+```js\n+let cityName;\n+```\n+\n+- To assign a value to a variable, you can use the assignment operator `=`.\n+\n+```js\n+cityName = 'New York';\n+```\n+\n+- Variables declared using `let` can be reassigned a new value.\n+\n+```js\n+cityName = 'Los Angeles';\n+console.log(cityName); // Los Angeles\n+```\n+\n+- Apart from `let`, you can also use `const` to declare a variable. However, a `const` variable cannot be reassigned a new value.\n+\n+```js\n+const cityName = 'New York';\n+cityName = 'Los Angeles'; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.\n+```\n+\n+- Variables declared using `const` find uses in declaring constants, that are not allowed to change through out the code, such as `PI` or `MAX_SIZE`.\n+\n+## Variable Naming Conventions\n+\n+- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.\n+- Variable names should be camelCase like `cityName`, `isLoggedin`, and `veryBigNumber`.\n+- Variable names should not start with a number. They must begin with a letter, `_`, or `$`.\n+- Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters, except for `_` and `$`.\n+- Variable names should not be reserved keywords.\n+- Variable names are case-sensitive. `age` and `Age` are different variables.\n+\n+## Strings and String immutability in JavaScript\n+\n+- Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They can be created using single quotes and double quotes.\n+\n+```js\n+let correctWay = 'This is a string';\n+let alsoCorrect = \"This is also a string\";\n+```\n+\n+- Strings are immutable in JavaScript. This means that once a string is created, you cannot change the characters in the string. However, you can still reassign strings to a new value.\n+\n+```js\n+let firstName = 'John';\n+firstName = 'Jane'; // Reassigning the string to a new value\n+```\n+\n+## String Concatenation in JavaScript\n+\n+- Concatenation is the process of joining multiple strings or combining strings with variables that hold text. The `+` operator is one of the simplest and most frequently used methods to concatenate strings. \n+\n+```js\n+let studentName = 'Asad';\n+let studentAge = 25;\n+let studentInfo = studentName + ' is ' + studentAge + ' years old.';\n+console.log(studentInfo); // Asad is 25 years old.\n+```\n+\n+- If you need to add or append to an existing string, then you can use the  `+=` operator. This is helpful when you want to build upon a string by adding more text to it over time.\n+\n+```js\n+let message = 'Welcome to programming, ';\n+message += 'Asad!';\n+console.log(message); // Welcome to programming, Asad!\n+```\n+\n+- Another way you can concatenate strings is to use the concat method. This method joins two or more strings together.\n+\n+```js\n+let firstName = 'John';\n+let lastName = 'Doe';\n+let fullName = firstName.concat(' ', lastName);\n+console.log(fullName); // John Doe\n+```\n+\n+## Logging Messages with `console.log()`\n+\n+- The `console.log()` method is used to log messages to the console. It's a helpful tool for debugging and testing your code.\n+\n+```js\n+console.log('Hello, World!');\n+// Output: Hello, World!\n+```\n+\n+## Semicolons in JavaScript\n+\n+- Semicolons are primarily used to mark the end of a statement. This helps the JavaScript engine understand the separation of individual instructions, which is crucial for correct execution.\n+\n+```js\n+let message = 'Hello, World!'; // first statement ends here\n+let number = 42; // second statement starts here\n+```\n+\n+- Semicolons help prevent ambiguities in code execution and ensure that statements are correctly terminated.\n+\n+## Comments in JavaScript\n+\n+- Any line of code that is commented out is ignored by the JavaScript engine. Comments are used to explain code, make notes, or temporarily disable code.\n+- Single line comments are created using `//`.\n+\n+```js\n+// This is a single line comment and will be ignored by the JavaScript engine\n+```\n+\n+- Multi-line comments are created using `/*` to start the comment and `*/` to end the comment.\n+\n+```js\n+/*\n+This is a multi-line comment.\n+It can span multiple lines.\n+*/\n+```\n+\n+## JavaScript as a Dynamically Typed Language\n+\n+- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. The JavaScript engine automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.\n+\n+```js\n+let error = 404; // JavaScript treats error as a number\n+error = \"Not Found\"; // JavaScript now treats error as a string\n+```\n+\n+- Other languages, like Java, that are not dynamically typed would result in an error:\n+\n+```js\n+int error = 404; // value must always be an integer\n+error = \"Not Found\"; // This would cause an error in Java\n+```\n+\n+## Using the `typeof` Operator\n+\n+- The `typeof` operator is used to check the data type of a variable. It returns a string indicating the type of the variable.\n+\n+```js\n+let age = 25;\n+console.log(typeof age); // number\n+\n+let isLoggedin = true;\n+console.log(typeof isLoggedin); // boolean\n+```\n+\n+- However, there’s a well-known quirk in JavaScript when it comes to null. The `typeof` operator returns `object` for null values.\n+\n+```js\n+let user = null;\n+console.log(typeof user); // object\n+```\n \n # --assignment--\n "
