On Gitpod, a terminal is open at the bottom of the editor by default.\n-\n-It is recommended to keep the terminal open while working at these challenges. By reading the output in the terminal, you can see any errors that may occur.\n-\n-The server must be restarted after making changes to its files.\n-\n-You can stop the server from the terminal using `Ctrl + C` and start it using Node directly (`node mainEntryFile.js`) or using a run script in the `package.json` file with `npm run`.\n-\n-For example, the `\"start\": \"node server.js\"` script would be run from the terminal using `npm run start`.\n-\n-To implement server auto restarting on file save Node provides the `--watch` flag you can add to your start script `\"start\": \"node --watch server.js\"` or you can install a npm package like `nodemon`.

This object has several methods, and you will learn many of them in these challenges. One fundamental method is `app.listen(port)`. It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in running state. For testing reasons, the app needs to be running in the background, so this method has been added in the `server.js` file for you.\n-\n-Let’s serve our first string! In Express, routes takes the following structure: `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`. METHOD is an HTTP method in lowercase. PATH is a relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is matched. Handlers take the form `function(req, res) {...}`, where req is the request object, and res is the response object. For example, the handler\n-\n-```js\n-function(req, res) {\n-  res.send('Response String');\n-}\n-```\n-\n-will serve the string 'Response String'.\n-\n-# --instructions--\n-\n-Use the `app.get()` method to serve the string \"Hello Express\" to GET requests matching the `/` (root) path. Be sure that your code works by looking at the logs, then see the results in the preview if you are using Gitpod.\n-\n-**Note:** All the code for these lessons should be added in between the few lines of code that have been\n-written for you. \n-\n-# --hints--\n-\n-Your app should serve the string 'Hello Express'\n-\n-```js\n-(getUserInput) =>\n-  $.get(getUserInput('url')).then(\n-    (data) => {\n-      assert.equal(\n-        data,\n-        'Hello Express',\n-        'Your app does not serve the text \"Hello Express\"'\n-      );\n-    },\n-    (xhr) => {\n-      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);\n-    }\n-  );\n-```\n-"

A <dfn>REST</dfn> (REpresentational State Transfer) API allows data exchange in a simple way, without the need for clients to know any detail about the server. The client only needs to know where the resource is (the URL), and the action it wants to perform on it (the verb). The GET verb is used when you are fetching some information, without modifying anything. These days, the preferred data format for moving information around the web is JSON. Simply put, JSON is a convenient way to represent a JavaScript object as a string, so it can be easily transmitted.\n-\n-The first thing you will create is a simple API. Create a route that responds with JSON at the path `/json`. You can do it as usual, with the `app.get()` method. Inside the route handler, use the method `res.json()`, passing in an object as an argument. This method closes the request-response loop, returning the data. Behind the scenes, it converts a valid JavaScript object into a string, then sets the appropriate headers to tell your browser that you are serving JSON, and sends the data back. A valid object has the usual structure `{key: data}`. `data` can be a number, a string, a nested object or an array. `data` can also be a variable or the result of a function call, in which case it will be evaluated before being converted into a string.\n-\n-# --instructions--\n-\n-Serve the object `{\"message\": \"Hello json\"}` as a response, in JSON format, to GET requests to the `/json` route.

This file is secret, no one but you can access it, and it can be used to store data that you want to keep private or hidden. For example, you can store API keys from external services or your database URI. You can also use it to store configuration options. By setting configuration options, you can change the behavior of your application, without the need to rewrite some code.\n-\n-The environment variables are accessible from the app as `process.env.VAR_NAME`. The `process.env` object is a global Node object, and variables are passed as strings. By convention, the variable names are all uppercase, with words separated by an underscore. The `.env` is a shell file, so you don’t need to wrap names or values in quotes. It is also important to note that there cannot be space around the equals sign when you are assigning values to your variables, e.g. `VAR_NAME=value`. Usually, you will put each variable definition on a separate line.\n-\n-# --instructions--\n-\n-For this challenge you should add an environment variable as a configuration option.\n-\n-Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory, and store the variable `MESSAGE_STYLE=uppercase` in it.\n-\n-Then, in the `/json` GET route handler you created in the last challenge access `process.env.MESSAGE_STYLE` and transform the response object's `message` to uppercase if the variable equals `uppercase`. The response object should either be `{\"message\": \"Hello json\"}` or `{\"message\": \"HELLO JSON\"}`, depending on the `MESSAGE_STYLE` value.

Now it’s time to see what middleware is, in more detail. Middleware functions are functions that take 3 arguments: the request object, the response object, and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add information to the request or response objects. They can also end the cycle by sending a response when some condition is met. If they don’t send the response when they are done, they start the execution of the next function in the stack. This triggers calling the 3rd argument, `next()`.\n-\n-Look at the following example:\n-\n-```js\n-function(req, res, next) {\n-  console.log(\"I'm a middleware...\");\n-  next();\n-}\n-```\n-\n-Let’s suppose you mounted this function on a route. When a request matches the route, it displays the string “I’m a middleware…”, then it executes the next function in the stack. In this exercise, you are going to build root-level middleware. As you have seen in challenge 4, to mount a middleware function at root level, you can use the `app.use(<mware-function>)` method. In this case, the function will be executed for all the requests, but you can also set more specific conditions. For example, if you want a function to be executed only for POST requests, you could use `app.post(<mware-function>)`. Analogous methods exist for all the HTTP verbs (GET, DELETE, PUT, …).\n-\n-# --instructions--\n-\n-Build a simple logger. For every request, it should log to the console a string taking the following format: `method path - ip`. An example would look like this: `GET /json - ::ffff:127.0.0.1`. Note that there is a space between `method` and `path` and that the dash separating `path` and `ip` is surrounded by a space on both sides. You can get the request method (http verb), the relative route path, and the caller’s ip from the request object using `req.method`, `req.path` and `req.ip`. Remember to call `next()` when you are done, or your server will be stuck forever. Be sure to have the ‘Logs’ opened, and see what happens when some request arrives.\n-\n-**Note:** Express evaluates functions in the order they appear in the code. This is true for middleware too. If you want it to work for all the routes, it should be mounted before them.\n-\n-# --hints--\n-\n-Root level logger middleware should be active\n-\n-```js\n-(getUserInput) =>\n-  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/root-middleware-logger').then(\n-    (data) => {\n-      assert.isTrue(\n-        data.passed,\n-        'root-level logger is not working as expected'\n-      );\n-    },\n-    (xhr) => {\n-      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);\n-    }\n-  );\n-```\n-"

For example, if the client is requesting information about a user stored in the database, they need a way to let us know which user they're interested in. One possible way to achieve this result is by using route parameters. Route parameters are named segments of the URL, delimited by slashes (/).

The query string is delimited by a question mark (?), and includes field=value couples. Each couple is separated by an ampersand (&). Express can parse the data from the query string, and populate the object `req.query`. Some characters, like the percent (%), cannot be in URLs and have to be encoded in a different format before you can send them. If you use the API from JavaScript, you can use specific methods to encode/decode these characters.\n-\n-<blockquote>route_path: '/library'<br>actual_request_URL: '/library?userId=546&#x26;bookId=6754' <br>req.query: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}</blockquote>\n-\n-# --instructions--\n-\n-Build an API endpoint, mounted at `GET /name`.

If you want, you can use the method `app.route(path).get(handler).post(handler)`. This syntax allows you to chain different verb handlers on the same path route. You can save a bit of typing, and have cleaner code.\n-\n-# --hints--\n-\n-Test 1 : Your API endpoint should respond with `{ \"name\": \"Mick Jagger\" }` when the `/name` endpoint is called with `?first=Mick&last=Jagger`\n-\n-```js\n-(getUserInput) =>\n-  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/name?first=Mick&last=Jagger').then(\n-    (data) => {\n-      assert.equal(\n-        data.name,\n-        'Mick Jagger',\n-        'Test 1: \"GET /name\" route does not behave as expected'\n-      );\n-    },\n-    (xhr) => {\n-      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);\n-    }\n-  );\n-```\n-\n-Test 2 : Your API endpoint should respond with `{ \"name\": \"Keith Richards\" }` when the `/name` endpoint is called with `?first=Keith&last=Richards`\n-\n-```js\n-(getUserInput) =>\n-  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/name?last=Richards&first=Keith').then(\n-    (data) => {\n-      assert.equal(\n-        data.name,\n-        'Keith Richards',\n-        'Test 2: \"GET /name\" route does not behave as expected'\n-      );\n-    },\n-    (xhr) => {\n-      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);\n-    }\n-  );\n-```\n-"

POST is the default method used to send client data with HTML forms. In REST convention, POST is used to send data to create new items in the database (a new user, or a new blog post). You don’t have a database in this project, but you are going to learn how to handle POST requests anyway.\n-\n-In these kind of requests, the data doesn’t appear in the URL, it is hidden in the request body. The body is a part of the HTTP request, also called the payload. Even though the data is not visible in the URL, this does not mean that it is private. To see why, look at the raw content of an HTTP POST request:\n-\n-```http\n-POST /path/subpath HTTP/1.0\n-From: john@example.com\n-User-Agent: someBrowser/1.0\n-Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n-Content-Length: 20\n-\n-name=John+Doe&age=25\n-```\n-\n-As you can see, the body is encoded like the query string. This is the default format used by HTML forms. With Ajax, you can also use JSON to handle data having a more complex structure. There is also another type of encoding: multipart/form-data. This one is used to upload binary files. In this exercise, you will use a URL encoded body. To parse the data coming from POST requests, you must use the `body-parser` package. This package allows you to use a series of middleware, which can decode data in different formats.\n-\n-# --instructions--\n-\n-`body-parser` has already been installed and is in your project's `package.json` file. `require` it at the top of the `myApp.js` file and store it in a variable named `bodyParser`. The middleware to handle URL encoded data is returned by `bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false})`. Pass the function returned by the previous method call to `app.use()`. As usual, the middleware must be mounted before all the routes that depend on it.\n-\n-**Note:** `extended` is a configuration option that tells `body-parser` which parsing needs to be used. When `extended=false` it uses the classic encoding `querystring` library. When `extended=true` it uses `qs` library for parsing. \n-\n-When using `extended=false`, values can be only strings or arrays. The object returned when using `querystring` does not prototypically inherit from the default JavaScript `Object`, which means functions like `hasOwnProperty`, `toString` will not be available. The extended version allows more data flexibility, but it is outmatched by JSON.\n-\n-# --hints--\n-\n-The 'body-parser' middleware should be mounted\n-\n-```js\n-(getUserInput) =>\n-  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/add-body-parser').then(\n-    (data) => {\n-      assert.isAbove(\n-        data.mountedAt,\n-        0,\n-        '\"body-parser\" is not mounted correctly'\n-      );\n-    },\n-    (xhr) => {\n-      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);\n-    }\n-  );\n-```\n-"

Test if your endpoint works using the html form provided in the app frontpage.\n-\n-Tip: There are several other http methods other than GET and POST. And by convention there is a correspondence between the http verb, and the operation you are going to execute on the server. The conventional mapping is:\n-\n-POST (sometimes PUT) - Create a new resource using the information sent with the request,\n-\n-GET - Read an existing resource without modifying it,\n-\n-PUT or PATCH (sometimes POST) - Update a resource using the data sent,\n-\n-DELETE - Delete a resource.\n-\n-There are also a couple of other methods which are used to negotiate a connection with the server.

But now, you want to allow the latest `1.2.x` version.\n-\n-Use the tilde (`~`) character to prefix the version of `@freecodecamp/example` in your dependencies, and allow npm to update it to any new _patch_ release.\n-\n-**Note:** The version numbers themselves should not be changed.\n-\n-# --hints--\n-\n-`\"dependencies\"` should include `\"@freecodecamp/example\"`.\n-\n-```js\n-(getUserInput) =>\n-  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/package.json').then(\n-    (data) => {\n-      var packJson = JSON.parse(data);\n-      assert.property(\n-        packJson.dependencies,\n-        '@freecodecamp/example',\n-        '\"dependencies\" does not include \"@freecodecamp/example\"'\n-      );\n-    },\n-    (xhr) => {\n-      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);\n-    }\n-  );\n-```\n-\n-`\"@freecodecamp/example\"` version should match `\"~1.2.13\"`.\n-\n-```js\n-(getUserInput) =>\n-  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/package.json').then(\n-    (data) => {\n-      var packJson = JSON.parse(data);\n-      assert.match(\n-        packJson.dependencies[\"@freecodecamp/example\"],\n-        /^\\~1\\.2\\.13/,\n-        'Wrong version of \"@freecodecamp/example\".
