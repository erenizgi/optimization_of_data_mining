For example, if your hat is `{'red': 2, 'blue': 1}`, `contents` should be `['red', 'red', 'blue']`.\n \n The `Hat` class should have a `draw` method that accepts an argument indicating the number of balls to draw from the hat. This method should remove balls at random from `contents` and return those balls as a list of strings. The balls should not go back into the hat during the draw, similar to an urn experiment without replacement. If the number of balls to draw exceeds the available quantity, return all the balls.\n \n Next, create an `experiment` function in `main.py` (not inside the `Hat` class). This function should accept the following arguments:\n \n - `hat`: A hat object containing balls that should be copied inside the function.\n-- `expected_balls`: An object indicating the exact group of balls to attempt to draw from the hat for the experiment. For example, to determine the probability of drawing 2 blue balls and 1 red ball from the hat, set `expected_balls` to `{\"blue\":2, \"red\":1}`.\n+- `expected_balls`: An object indicating the exact group of balls to attempt to draw from the hat for the experiment.
