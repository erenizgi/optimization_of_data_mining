It has been part of the language since its inception and for many years it remained the primary method for creating variables. However as JavaScript evolved and developers gained more experience with the language, certain drawbacks of using `var` became apparent leading to the introduction of `let` and `const` in 2015.\n \n-When you declare a variable with `var`, it becomes function-scoped or globally-scoped. This means that if you declare a variable inside a function using `var` it's only accessible within that function.
