As a result, the word `Hello` is extracted.\n \n If you omit the second parameter, `slice()` will extract everything from the start index to the end of the string:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let message = \"Hello, world!\";\n let world = message.slice(7);\n \n-console.log(world);  // Output: world!\n+console.log(world);  // world!\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, `slice(7)` extracts the string from index `7` to the end of the string, resulting in `world!`.\n \n You can also use negative numbers as indexes.
