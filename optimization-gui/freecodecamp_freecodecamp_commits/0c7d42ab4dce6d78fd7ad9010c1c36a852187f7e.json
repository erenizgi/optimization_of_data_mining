In this lesson, we are going to dive deeper into how to work with the CSS properties to create more visually appealing and complex designs.\n \n@@ -15,53 +15,98 @@ CSS supports two main types of gradients: linear gradients and radial gradients.\n \n Linear gradients create a gradual blend between colors along a straight line. You can control the direction of this line and the colors used. Here's a basic example of a linear gradient:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"linear-gradient\"></div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n .linear-gradient {\n   background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);\n   height: 40vh;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This creates a gradient that transitions from red on the left to blue on the right. The `to right` parameter specifies the direction of the gradient. You can use other directions like `to left`, `to top`, `to bottom`, or even specify angles like `45deg`.\n \n You can also use multiple color stops in a linear gradient:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"multi-color-gradient\"></div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n .multi-color-gradient {\n   background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow, blue);\n   height: 40vh;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This creates a gradient that transitions from red to yellow to blue, evenly spaced across the element.\n \n Radial gradients, on the other hand, create circular or elliptical gradients that radiate from a central point. Here's an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"radial-gradient\"></div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n .radial-gradient {\n   background: radial-gradient(circle, red, blue);\n   height: 40vh;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This creates a circular gradient that starts with red in the center and transitions to blue at the edges. You can also specify the shape and size of radial gradients:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"custom-radial-gradient\"></div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n .custom-radial-gradient {\n   background: radial-gradient(ellipse at top left, red, blue);\n   height: 40vh;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This creates an elliptical gradient starting from the top left corner of the element. Both linear and radial gradients allow you to specify color stops at precise positions. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"precise-gradient\"></div>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n .precise-gradient {\n   background: linear-gradient(to right, red 20%, yellow 40%, blue 80%);\n   height: 40vh;\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This creates a gradient where red takes up the first `20%`, then transitions to yellow at `40%`, and finally to blue at `80%`.\n \n Gradients can be used wherever you'd use an image in CSS. This makes them versatile for creating backgrounds, buttons, or even text effects when combined with other CSS properties."
