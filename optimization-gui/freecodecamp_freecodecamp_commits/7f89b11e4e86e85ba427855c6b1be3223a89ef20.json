It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML element, or even other web pages. Here's what the syntax of the `iframe` element looks like:\n+In a prior lesson, you were first introduced to the `iframe` element. In this lesson, you will learn more about how to work with the `iframe` element. This element stands for inline frame. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML element, or even other web pages.\n \n-```html\n-<iframe\n-  src=\"video-url\"\n-  width=\"width-value\"\n-  height=\"height-value\"\n-  allowfullscreen\n-></iframe>\n-```\n+Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube. To see a different video, change the `src` value to a video of your choosing.\n \n-The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to embed. The `width` attribute specifies the width of the `iframe`. The `height` attribute specifies the height of the `iframe`. The `allowfullscreen` attribute allows the user to display the `iframe` in full screen mode. It's also a good practice to specify a `title` attribute for the `iframe`, as it's important for accessibility.\n-\n-To embed a video within an `iframe` you can copy it directly from popular video services like YouTube and Vimeo, or define it yourself with the `src` attribute pointing to the URL of that video. Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube:\n+:::interactive_editor\n \n ```html\n-<h1>A freeCodeCamp YouTube Video Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>\n-\n <iframe\n-  width=\"560\"\n-  height=\"315\"\n+  width=\"400\"\n+  height=\"400\"\n   src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF\"\n-  title=\"YouTube video player\"\n+  title=\"Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners (YouTube video)\"\n   allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n   referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n   allowfullscreen\n ></iframe>\n ```\n \n-You can then customize the `iframe` to your needs or even define your own by copying the link to the YouTube video and pasting it in as the URL value. The caveat is that you must replace https://youtu.be with https://youtube.com/embed/.\n+:::\n \n-youtu.be is the domain when you copy the share link and youtube.com/embed/ is the domain required for embedding videos with the `iframe` element. Here's an example of that:\n-\n-```html\n-<iframe\n-  src=\"https://youtube.com/embed/gp5H0Vw39yw?si=Rb_2nDK6abv1iIAM\"\n-  title=\"freeCodeCamp Typescript Course\"\n-  width=\"500\"\n-  height=\"285\"\n-  allowfullscreen\n-></iframe>\n-```\n+The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to embed. The `width` attribute specifies the width of the `iframe`. The `height` attribute specifies the height of the `iframe`. The `allowfullscreen` attribute allows the user to display the `iframe` in full screen mode. It's also a good practice to specify a `title` attribute for the `iframe`, as it's important for accessibility.\n \n-Note that the video can come from anywhere. It doesn't have to come from video services like YouTube and Vimeo. Here's a video from Pixabay embedded with the `iframe` element:\n+Note that the video can come from anywhere.
