T\n ### Binary Search\n \n - Binary search works by dividing a list of items in half, and checking if the target value is in the middle of the list.\n-- The condition for binary search to work is that the items in the list must be in ascending order.\n+- The condition for binary search to work is that the items in the list must be sorted, either in ascending or descending order.\n - Binary search is a more efficient algorithm for searching through a large list of items because it divides the list of items in half and ignores any half where the target is not found.\n - If the target item is found in the middle of the list, the index of the target item is returned.\n - If the item is not found, the algorithm checks if the target item is in the left or right half of the list."
