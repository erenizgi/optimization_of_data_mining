When you use a percentage value, you're essentially saying, \"Make this X% of its container.\"\n \n For example, if you set `width: 50%` on an element, it will occupy half the width of its parent container. This makes percentages incredibly useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"container\">\n+  <div class=\"box\"></div>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+.container {\n+  width: 400px;\n+  height: 200px;\n+  background-color: lightgray;\n+}\n+\n+.box {\n+  width: 50%;\n+  height: 100%;\n+  background-color: red;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n Percentages are ideal for creating fluid layouts that adjust to various screen sizes. For instance, setting a container to `width: 80%` ensures it takes up 80% of its parent's width, regardless of the device.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"parent\">\n+  <div class=\"child\"></div>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+.parent {\n+  width: 100%;\n+  height: 300px;\n+  background-color: lightblue;\n+}\n+\n+.child {\n+  width: 80%;\n+  height: 100%;\n+  background-color: red;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n Using percentages for flexible images is another common practice. By applying `max-width: 100%` to images, you allow them to scale down on smaller screens while maintaining their aspect ratio.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<img src=\"https://placehold.co/150x150\" alt=\"Example Product Image\" />\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+img {\n+  max-width: 100%;\n+  height: auto;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n While less common, percentages can also be used for font sizes to create scalable typography. For example, `font-size: 120%` would make the text 20% larger than its parent's font size.\n \n-Percentages can be particularly handy for vertical centering. Here's an example of how you might use percentages with the transform property to center an element vertically:\n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" />\n+<div class=\"text-container\">\n+  Parent text.\n+  <p class=\"text\">This is some example text.</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n \n ```css\n-.center-me {\n+.text-container {\n+  font-size: 16px;\n+}\n+\n+.text {\n+  font-size: 120%;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+:::\n+\n+Percentages can be particularly handy for vertical centering.
