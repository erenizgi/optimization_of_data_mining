One such surprise occurs when you mix numbers and strings in calculations. The first thing you'll probably try is to add a number and a string. In JavaScript, the `+` operator does double duty. It handles both addition and string concatenation, which is a way to join two strings together.\n \n When you use `+` with a number and a string, JavaScript decides to treat them both as strings and joins them together. If you check the type of the result with the `typeof` operator, you'd see it's indeed a string:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = 5 + '10';\n \n console.log(result); // 510\n console.log(typeof result); // string\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n What do you think will happen if you switch the order of `5` and `'10'`?\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = '10' + 5;\n \n console.log(result); // 105\n console.log(typeof result); // string\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n You can see the same thing happened. JavaScript sees a string in `'10'` and a number in `5`, so it converts the number to a string and concatenates them. This is known as type coercion. Type coercion is when a value from one data type is converted into another.\n \n Things get more interesting when you try to perform other arithmetic operations like subtraction, multiplication, or division with a string and number. In these cases, JavaScript tries to convert the string into a number before doing the math – another type coercion! Here's what happens:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const subtractionResult = '10' - 5;\n console.log(subtractionResult); // 5\n@@ -45,10 +55,14 @@ console.log(divisionResult); // 10\n console.log(typeof divisionResult); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In the examples above, JavaScript successfully converts the string `'10'` or `'20'` to a number and then performs the calculation. As a result, `'10' - 5` yields `5`, `'10' * 2` gives `20`, and `'20' / 2` results in `10`.\n \n But what if the string doesn't look like a number? Let's see what happens in that case:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const subtractionResult = 'abc' - 5;\n console.log(subtractionResult); // NaN\n@@ -63,10 +77,14 @@ console.log(divisionResult); // NaN\n console.log(typeof divisionResult); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In the examples above, the string `'abc'` does not represent a valid numeric value, so JavaScript cannot convert it into a meaningful number. When such conversion fails, JavaScript returns `NaN`, which stands for \"Not a Number\". `NaN` is a special value of the `Number` type that represents an invalid or unrepresentable number.\n \n What if you perform arithmetic operations with a boolean (`true` or `false`)? Let's see what happens. JavaScript treats booleans as numbers in mathematical operations: `true` becomes `1`, and `false` becomes `0`.\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result1 = true + 1;\n console.log(result1); // 2\n@@ -81,10 +99,14 @@ console.log(result3); // \"Hellotrue\"\n console.log(typeof result3); // string\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In the first two examples, `true + 1` resulted in `2`, and `false + 1` resulted in `1`. In the third example, `'Hello' + true`, JavaScript converted `true` to a string and concatenates it with `'Hello'`, resulting in `'Hellotrue'`, which is a string.\n \n For `null` and `undefined`, JavaScript treats `null` as `0` and `undefined` as `NaN` in mathematical operations:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result1 = null + 5;\n console.log(result1); // 5\n@@ -95,6 +117,8 @@ console.log(result2); // NaN\n console.log(typeof result2); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n JavaScript often performs type coercion, automatically converting data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans in sometimes unexpected ways. Understanding these conversions is crucial for avoiding bugs and writing robust code in your projects.\n \n # --questions--"
