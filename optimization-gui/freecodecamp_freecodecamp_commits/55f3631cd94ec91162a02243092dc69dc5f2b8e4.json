Numbers might seem simple, but there's a lot to explore when it comes to numbers in JavaScript. So, let's take a deeper look. In JavaScript, the `Number` data type represents a numeric value.\n \n Unlike many other programming languages that separate integers and floating-point numbers into different types, JavaScript uses one unified `Number` type to account for numbers. This means you can work with whole numbers, decimals, and even special numeric values all under the same `Number` data type umbrella.\n \n Here's a basic example showing you integers, floating point numbers, and negative numbers are all of type number:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const wholeNumber = 50;\n const decimalNumber = 4.5;\n@@ -23,8 +25,12 @@ console.log(typeof decimalNumber); // number\n console.log(typeof negativeNumber); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n JavaScript's `Number` type includes various kinds of numeric values, ranging from simple integers and floating-point numbers to special cases like `Infinity` and `NaN`, or \"Not a Number\". Let's break down the main types you'll encounter. Integers are whole numbers without any fractional or decimal part. They can be positive, negative, or zero. Here are some examples:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const positiveInteger = 100;\n const negativeInteger = -25;\n@@ -35,8 +41,12 @@ console.log(typeof negativeInteger); // number\n console.log(typeof zero); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Floating point numbers are numbers with decimal points. They're often referred to as just \"floats\" by JavaScript developers. Floats are useful when you need more precision, such as when you're dealing with measurements or currencies. Here are some examples:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const floatingPointNumber = 4.5;\n const anotherFloat = 89.56;\n@@ -47,28 +57,42 @@ console.log(typeof anotherFloat); // number\n console.log(typeof oneMoreFloat); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n JavaScript can represent numbers that are beyond the maximum limit with `Infinity`. You'll encounter this when you try to divide a number by zero or on rare occasions, exceed the upper boundary of the `Number` type. Here's an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const infiniteNumber = 1 / 0;\n console.log(infiniteNumber); // Infinity\n console.log(typeof infiniteNumber); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Sometimes in JavaScript, some mathematical operations don't result in a valid number. For instance, if you try to perform a mathematical operation on something that isn't a number, you'll get `NaN`, which stands for \"Not a Number\":\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const notANumber = 'hello world' / 2;\n console.log(notANumber); // NaN\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Surprisingly, the type of `NaN` is also `Number`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const notANumber = 'hello world' / 2;\n console.log(typeof notANumber); // number\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Apart from the standard decimal system (base 10), JavaScript also supports numbers in different bases such as binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Binary is a base-2 system that uses only digits 1 and 0. Octal is a base-8 system that uses only digits 0 to 7. Hexadecimal is a base-16 system that uses digits 0 to 9 and letters a to f, like you see in CSS hex colors.\n \n # --questions--"
