But what if we wanted the message to say `Hello, Nick!` or `Hello, Anna!`? We don't want to write a new function each time we greet a different user. Instead, we can create a reusable function that uses function parameters and arguments. \n \n Parameters act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called. They allow functions to accept input and work with that input. Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called. Here is an updated version of the `greet` function that uses parameters and arguments:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n function greet(name) {\n   console.log(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\");\n@@ -40,21 +46,29 @@ greet(\"Alice\"); // Hello, Alice!\n greet(\"Nick\"); // Hello, Nick!\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The `name` serves as the parameter while the strings `Alice` and `Nick` serve as the arguments. Now we have a reusable function that can be used dozens of times throughout our code with different arguments. \n \n When a function finishes its execution, it will always return a value. By default, the return value will be `undefined`. Here is an example: \n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n function doSomething() {\n-    console.log(\"Doing something...\");\n+  console.log(\"Doing something...\");\n }\n \n let result = doSomething();\n console.log(result); // undefined\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n If you need your function to return a specific value, then you will need to use the `return` statement.

We are then able to call `sum` and pass in the numbers `3` and `4` to get the result of `7`. \n \n Functions support default parameters, allowing you to set default values for parameters. These default values are used if the function is called without an argument for that parameter.

They can take inputs (parameters), perform actions, and return outputs."
