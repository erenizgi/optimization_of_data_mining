You will implement functions to add, update, delete, and view user settings.\n+\n+**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.\n+\n+**User Stories:**\n+\n+1. You should define a function named `add_setting` with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair\n+\n+1. `add_setting` function should:\n+    \n+   - Convert the key and value to lowercase.\n+   - If the key setting exists, return `Setting '[key]' already exists! Cannot add a new setting with this name.`\n+   - If the key setting doesn't exist, add the key-value pair to the given dictionary of settings and return `Setting '[key]' added with value '[value]' successfully!`.\n+   - The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.\n+\n+1. You should define a function named `update_setting` with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair.\n+\n+1. `update_setting` function should:\n+       \n+   - Convert the key and value to lowercase.\n+   - If the key setting exists, update its value in the given dictionary of settings and return: `Setting '[key]' updated to '[value]' successfully!`\n+   - If the key setting doesn't exist, return `Setting '[key]' does not exist! Cannot update a non-existing setting.`\n+   - The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.\n+\n+\n+1. You should define a function named `delete_setting` with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a key.\n+\n+1. `delete_setting` function should:\n+    \n+   - Convert the key passed to lowercase.\n+   - If the key setting exists, remove the key-value pair from the given dictionary of settings and return `Setting '[key]' deleted successfully!`\n+   - If the key setting does not exist, return `Setting not found!`\n+   - The messages returned should have the key in lowercase.\n+\n+1. You should define a function named `view_settings` with one parameter representing a dictionary of settings.\n+\n+1. `view_settings` function should:\n+   \n+   - Return `No settings available.` if the given dictionary of settings is empty. \n+   - If the dictionary contains any settings, return a string displaying the settings. The string should start with `Current User Settings:` followed by the key-value pairs, each on a new line and with the key capitalized. For example, `view_settings({'theme': 'dark', 'notifications': 'enabled', 'volume': 'high'})` should return:\n+\n+   ```md\n+   Current User Settings:\n+   Theme: dark\n+   Notifications: enabled\n+   Volume: high\n+   \n+   ```\n+\n+1.
