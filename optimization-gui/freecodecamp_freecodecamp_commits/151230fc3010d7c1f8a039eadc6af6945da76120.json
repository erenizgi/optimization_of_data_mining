These have a moderate level of specificity.\n+\n+Type selectors, such as `div` and `h1`, and pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`, have a lower specificity compared to the previous groups.\n+\n+Finally, the universal selector, represented by an asterisk `*`, has the lowest specificity of all.\n+\n+Specificity values are calculated as a four-part value `(a, b, c, d)`:\n+\n+- `a`: Inline styles (`1` or `0`).\n+- `b`: Number of ID selectors.\n+- `c`: Number of class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes.\n+- `d`: Number of type selectors, pseudo-elements, and universal selectors.\n+\n+Each part of the specificity value carries different weight:\n+\n+- **Inline styles** (`a`) have the highest weight, contributing a value of `1` to the first part of the specificity value.\n+    \n+- **ID selectors** (`b`) carry the next highest weight, with each ID contributing `1` to the second part of the specificity value.\n+    \n+- **Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes** (`c`) carry moderate weight, with each contributing `1` to the third part of the specificity value.\n+    \n+- **Type selectors and pseudo-elements** (`d`) have the lowest weight, with each contributing `1` to the fourth part of the specificity value.\n+    \n+- **Universal selector** (`*`): The universal selector contributes `0` to the specificity calculation and does not affect specificity. Its inclusion in a selector does not change the specificity value.\n+\n+Inline CSS has the highest specificity because it is applied directly to the element. It overrides any internal or external CSS. The specificity value for inline styles is `(1, 0, 0, 0)`.\n+\n+Here is an example using inline styles for a `div` element.\n+\n+```html\n+<div style=\"color: red;\">This text is red.</div>\n+```\n+\n+In this example, the text will always be red, regardless of any other styles applied via internal or external CSS.\n+\n+Internal CSS is defined within a `style` element in the `head` section of the HTML document. It has lower specificity than inline styles but can override external styles.\n+\n+The specificity value for internal styles is determined by the selectors used. For example, an ID selector within internal CSS has a specificity value of `(0, 1, 0, 0)`.\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <style>\n+    .text {\n+      color: blue;\n+    }\n+  </style>\n+</head>\n+<body>\n+  <div class=\"text\">This text is blue.</div>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+In this example, the text will be blue unless an inline style or a more specific external style is applied.\n+\n+External CSS is linked via a `link` element in the `head` section and is written in separate `.css` files. It has the lowest specificity but provides the best maintainability for larger projects.\n+\n+The specificity value for external styles is also determined by the selectors used. For example, a class selector within external CSS has a specificity value of `(0, 0, 1, 0)`.\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+</head>\n+<body>\n+  <div class=\"text\">This text's color is defined in an external CSS file.</div>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+In this example, the text color is defined in the `styles.css` file and will be applied unless overridden by internal or inline styles.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

It ensures that the most appropriate styles are used, based on a set of well-defined rules.\n+\n+The process begins with **relevance**. The browser first filters all the CSS rules to find those that actually apply to the element in question. This includes matching selectors and considering media queries that might be in effect.\n+\n+A media query is a CSS technique used to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as its width, height, or orientation.\n+\n+Next, the algorithm considers **origin and importance**. CSS can come from different sources: the browser’s default styles (user-agent), styles set by the user, and styles written by the author (you).\n+\n+Following the consideration of origin, the algorithm then evaluates the importance of each rule, giving priority to rules marked with `!important`, which override other rules regardless of their source.\n+\n+After filtering by origin and importance, the algorithm looks at **specificity**. When two rules from the same origin and importance level apply, the rule with the higher specificity will be applied.\n+\n+Specificity is a measure of how targeted a selector is, with more specific selectors taking precedence over more general ones.\n+\n+Finally, if everything else is equal, the **order of appearance** comes into play. When two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the CSS will be applied.\n+\n+This is why the order in which you write your styles can sometimes affect the outcome.\n+\n+Let's take a look at an example.\n+\n+Here we have a single paragraph element on the page:\n+\n+```html\n+<p>example paragraph</p>\n+```\n+\n+Inside the CSS, we have two rules each targeting the paragraph element.\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  color: blue;\n+}\n+\n+p {\n+  color: green; \n+}\n+```\n+\n+The first rule sets all paragraph elements to the text color of blue while the second rule sets all paragraph elements to the text color of green.\n+\n+So which color will be applied? The color green will be applied to the paragraph elements.\n+\n+By considering relevance, origin and importance, specificity, scope, and order of appearance, the Cascade Algorithm ensures that your CSS behaves predictably, allowing you to design more complex and nuanced web pages.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

For example, properties like `color`, `font-family`, and `line-height` are inherited. This means that if you set the text color on a parent element, all of its child elements will inherit that color unless you specifically override it.\n+\n+For instance, consider the following example where a parent `div` element has its color set using an inline style, and the child `p` element inherits that color:\n+\n+```html\n+<div style=\"color: blue;\">\n+  This is the parent element.\n+  <p>This is the child element inheriting the color.</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+In this case, both the parent `div` and the child `p` will display their text in blue because the color is inherited.\n+\n+On the other hand, properties like `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `background` are not inherited by default. If you want a child element to inherit these styles, you need to explicitly set them, either directly on the child element or by using the `inherit` keyword.\n+\n+The `inherit` keyword can be used to force inheritance of a property from a parent element, even if that property is not normally inherited.\n+\n+For example, if you want a specific child element to have the same `padding` as its parent, you can set `padding: inherit` on the child element:\n+\n+```html\n+<div style=\"padding: 20px;\">\n+  This is the parent element with padding.\n+  <p style=\"padding: inherit;\">This is the child element inheriting the padding.</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+In this case, the child `p` element will inherit the `20px` of padding from its parent `div` element.\n+\n+Inheritance is especially useful for maintaining consistency and reducing redundancy in your stylesheets.\n+\n+Instead of writing the same style rule for multiple elements, you can define it once on a parent element, and the child elements will inherit it. This can make your CSS more concise and easier to manage.\n+\n+However, it’s important to remember that inheritance only works in one direction – from parent to child. If you override a style on a child element, it won’t affect the parent element.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

This contrast is crucial for users to quickly scan a page and find navigational elements or important information.\n+\n+The underline further emphasizes that the text is clickable, providing an additional visual cue. This is particularly helpful for users who may be colorblind or have difficulty distinguishing colors.\n+\n+The change in color for visited links (typically to purple) helps users keep track of where they've been. This feature is invaluable for navigating large websites or conducting research, as it prevents users from inadvertently revisiting the same pages.\n+\n+Consider this HTML example:\n+\n+```html\n+<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.example.com/cats\">cats</a> and <a href=\"https://www.example.com/dogs\">dogs</a>.</p>\n+```\n+\n+Without any custom CSS, most browsers will render these links in blue with an underline. After clicking on one of the links, its color will change to purple, providing immediate feedback to the user about their browsing history.\n+\n+While it's common for designers to modify these default styles to match a website's aesthetic, it's crucial to maintain the core principles behind them.\n+\n+If you choose to change the default styles, ensure that links are still clearly distinguishable from regular text, there's a visible difference between visited and unvisited links, and the chosen colors provide sufficient contrast with the background.\n+\n+For example, you might use a custom style like this:\n+\n+```css\n+a:link {\n+  color: blue;\n+  text-decoration: none;\n+  border-bottom: 1px solid blue;\n+}\n+\n+a:visited {\n+  color: purple;\n+  border-bottom: 1px solid purple;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This maintains the blue and purple color scheme while replacing the underline with a bottom border for a more modern look.\n+\n+It's also important to consider the different states of links. In addition to the default and visited states, links typically have hover and active states:\n+\n+```css\n+a:hover {\n+  color: red;\n+}\n+\n+a:active {\n+  color: darkorange;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+These states provide immediate feedback to users as they interact with links, enhancing the overall usability of the site.\n+\n+In conclusion, while it's possible to customize link styles, the principles behind the default styles should be maintained.\n+\n+They play a crucial role in creating a usable and accessible web experience, helping users navigate and interact with content effectively.\n+\n+Always prioritize clarity and user experience when designing link styles for your websites.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

This helps users understand which links they have visited, which link they are interacting with, and what will happen when they click.\n+\n+For users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities, these distinct styles can make navigation much easier and more intuitive.\n+\n+Additionally, clear link states enhance the overall user experience by providing immediate feedback on user interactions, reducing confusion and improving the site's navigability.\n+\n+These states can be styled using something called `pseudo-classes` in CSS.\n+\n+A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element.\n+\n+For example, `:hover` can change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it, while `:visited` can change the color of a link that has already been visited.\n+\n+Pseudo-classes allow you to style elements based on their state or the user's interaction with them, without the need for additional markup in your HTML.\n+\n+The syntax of a `pseudo-class` looks something like this where `A` is the selector and `:B` is the `pseudo-class`:\n+\n+```css\n+A:B {\n+  property: value;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+To better understand how to style the different link states, let's take a look at some examples.\n+\n+The `:link` `pseudo-class` styles unvisited links, indicating that they are clickable.\n+\n+Here is an example of targeting an anchor element and using the `:link` pseudo-class:\n+\n+```css\n+/* Normal state (unvisited link) */\n+a:link { \n+  color: red;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+The above example will change the link's default blue color to `red` when it is unvisited.\n+\n+`:visited` styles links that have already been visited or clicked, helping users track which links they have clicked before.

It's a markup language used to apply styles for HTML.\n+\n+In simpler terms, if HTML is the structure of a web page, CSS is what makes it look good.\n+\n+The primary role of CSS is to separate the content of a web page from its visual presentation.\n+\n+This separation allows web developers to create more flexible and maintainable websites.\n+\n+With CSS, you can control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages without altering the HTML structure.\n+\n+Let's consider a simple analogy. If you think of a website as a house, HTML would be the foundation and framework, while CSS would be the paint, wallpaper, and decorations that make the house visually appealing and unique.\n+\n+CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them.\n+\n+These styles can include properties like color, font size, and many more. By changing these properties, you can dramatically alter how a web page looks without changing its content.\n+\n+One of the most powerful aspects of CSS is its ability to create responsive designs.\n+\n+This means that with CSS, you can make your website look great on any device, whether it's a desktop computer, a tablet, or a smartphone.\n+\n+CSS allows you to adjust layouts, font sizes, and other visual elements based on the screen size of the device viewing the website.\n+\n+Another important feature of CSS is its cascading nature, which is where the \"cascading\" in its name comes from.\n+\n+This means that styles can be inherited and overridden, allowing for a hierarchical structure of styling.\n+\n+CSS also supports the use of external stylesheets.\n+\n+This means you can keep all your styling rules in a separate file, which can then be linked to multiple HTML pages.\n+\n+This feature greatly enhances the maintainability of websites, especially larger ones. Instead of having to change styles on each individual page, you can make changes in one CSS file that will affect all linked pages.\n+\n+In the world of web development, CSS plays a vital role in creating visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly websites.\n+\n+It allows developers to transform simple HTML documents into engaging web experiences that capture users' attention and enhance their interaction with web content.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

Each declaration consists of a property and a value.\n+\n+The property is the CSS identifier that specifies which feature is being styled.

For example, if the property is `background-color`, a value could be `purple`, which sets the background color to purple.\n+\n+After each property name, you need to place a colon, and after each value, you should have a semicolon.\n+\n+Now that you know the syntax for a CSS rule, let's take a look at an example.\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  color: blue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this CSS rule, a type selector targets all paragraph elements on the page.\n+\n+Inside the declaration block, there is a one declaration.\n+\n+The declaration consists of the `color` property with a value set to `blue`.

These styles are called \"default browser styles\" or \"user-agent styles\".\n+\n+These default browser styles provide basic formatting to ensure that HTML elements are displayed in a readable way across all browsers.\n+\n+However, these styles can vary slightly from one browser to another, which is why it's important to understand them when designing a consistent look for your website.\n+\n+Let’s take a look at some common default browser styles applied to various HTML elements.\n+\n+Headings are one of the most commonly used HTML elements and are styled by default to have varying sizes and weights.\n+\n+For example, `h1` (the highest-level heading) is usually bold and larger in font size compared to lower-level headings like `h2`, `h3`, and so on.\n+\n+These heading tags help define the hierarchy and structure of your content.\n+\n+The following example shows all six heading elements from `h1` to `h6`.\n+\n+```html\n+<h1>Heading 1</h1>\n+<h2>Heading 2</h2>\n+<h3>Heading 3</h3>\n+<h4>Heading 4</h4>\n+<h5>Heading 5</h5>\n+<h6>Heading 6</h6>\n+```\n+\n+Another element with default styles is the `hr` element, which creates a horizontal rule often used to visually separate sections of content. Browsers generally apply a simple line style to this element.\n+\n+To understand it better, let's look at this code example:\n+\n+```html\n+<p>Paragraph 1</p>\n+<p>Paragraph 2</p>\n+<hr>\n+<p>Paragraph 3</p>\n+<p>Paragraph 4</p>\n+```\n+\n+The horizontal rule appears as a thin line with spacing above and below the text to distinguish between sections of content.\n+\n+Next, we will look at the `blockquote` element.\n+\n+Blockquotes are used to indicate a section of text that is a quotation from another source. Browsers typically add indentation and sometimes italicize the text.\n+\n+The indentation helps set blockquotes apart from the rest of the text, making it clear that this content is quoted from another source.\n+\n+Let's take a look at this code example:\n+\n+```html\n+<p>Paragraph 1</p>\n+<p>Paragraph 2</p>\n+<blockquote>I think, therefore I am. (Rene Descartes)</blockquote>\n+<p>Paragraph 3</p>\n+<p>Paragraph 4</p>\n+```\n+\n+In the example above, the `blockquote` element will produce an indent on the text, applied by the default browser styles.\n+\n+Another element with default styles is the anchor element (`<a>`), which is styled with a default blue color and underlining to make it recognizable as a link.\n+\n+Let's take at look at the following HTML example:\n+\n+```html\n+<p>Paragraph 1</p>\n+<p>Paragraph 2</p>\n+<a href=\"https://freecodecamp.org/\">Visit the freeCodeCamp learn page</a>\n+<p>Paragraph 3</p>\n+<p>Paragraph 4</p>\n+```\n+\n+The above code has four paragraph elements with an anchor element in the middle. The anchor element is styled in blue with an underline to show users to go to the freeCodeCamp learn page.\n+\n+Finally, we'll look at the unordered and ordered list elements.\n+\n+Browsers add basic formatting to lists, including indentation and bullets or numbers, depending on whether you are using an unordered list (`ul`) or an ordered list (`ol`).\n+\n+Let's take a look at an example:\n+\n+```html\n+<p>Sample Paragraph</p>\n+<ol>\n+  <li>item 1</li>\n+  <li>item 2</li>\n+  <li>item 3</li>\n+</ol>\n+<ul>\n+  <li>item</li>\n+  <li>another item</li>\n+  <li>yet another item</li>\n+</ul>\n+<p>Ending Paragraph</p>\n+```\n+\n+In the above code example, we are using an unordered list and an ordered list. Both of these lists will be slightly indented to the right by default.\n+\n+For all of these examples, you saw how the browser applied default spacing, varying font sizes, and weights to these HTML elements.\n+\n+In later lecture videos, you will learn how to reset some of these default styles using a CSS reset.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

It applies styles to a specific element.\n+\n+Here's an example using inline CSS:\n+\n+```html\n+<p style=\"color: red;\">This is an inline-styled paragraph.</p>\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we are using the `style` attribute to set the paragraph text to `red`.\n+\n+Inline CSS is generally used for quick, one-off styles or to override other styles for a specific element.\n+\n+However, it should be avoided in most cases because it can clutter the HTML and make the code harder to maintain.\n+\n+Most of the time, it's better to use internal or external CSS to keep your styles organized and maintainable.\n+\n+Internal CSS is written within the `style` tags inside the `head` section of an HTML document. It applies styles to the entire page and is useful when you need to style a single document.\n+\n+Here's an example of internal CSS:\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <style>\n+    p {\n+      color: blue;\n+    }\n+  </style>\n+</head>\n+<body>\n+  <p>This paragraph is styled using internal CSS.</p>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+In the above example, the internal CSS applies blue text to all `p` elements on the page.\n+\n+Internal CSS is best used when you need to apply styles to a specific page rather than across multiple pages. It’s useful for single-page websites or when the styles don’t need to be reused elsewhere.\n+\n+However, there are some downsides, such as not promoting reusability across multiple pages. Additionally, like inline CSS, it mixes HTML and CSS, making the code harder to maintain in larger projects.\n+\n+External CSS is written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document using the `link` element in the `head` section.\n+\n+It allows you to style multiple pages consistently and is the preferred method in professional web development.\n+\n+Here's the HTML part of our code example:\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+</head>\n+<body>\n+  <p>This paragraph is styled using external CSS.</p>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+In an earlier lecture video, you learned that the `link` element has a `rel` attribute that specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource, such as linking to a stylesheet or an external resource.\n+\n+On the other hand, the `href` attribute specifies the URL of the linked resource, indicating where the resource should be retrieved from.\n+\n+Here the CSS portion of the same example in separate file named `style.css`.\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  color: green;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This example targets all paragraph elements on the page and sets the text color to green.\n+\n+External CSS is ideal for large projects where you want to maintain a consistent style across multiple pages.\n+\n+It promotes separation of concerns by having HTML handle the structure and CSS handle the styling, which makes the code more maintainable and scalable.\n+\n+Understanding when to use each type of CSS is crucial for efficient and effective web development.\n+\n+In most cases, external CSS should be your go-to approach, especially for larger and more complex projects.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

If you do not specify a width, then the default is set to `auto`. This means the element will take up the full width of its parent container.\n+\n+The `height` property specifies the height of an element. Similarly, the height is `auto` by default, which means it will adjust to the content inside.\n+\n+Here's an example using the `width` and `height` properties:\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <style>\n+    .box {\n+      width: 100px;\n+      height: 100px;\n+      background-color: skyblue\n+    }\n+  </style>\n+</head>\n+<body>\n+  <div class=\"box\"></div>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we have a `div` element with class named `box`. This element will be occupying `100px` in height and width, whereas the background color will be `skyblue`.\n+\n+Pixels are a fixed-size unit of measurement in CSS, providing precise control over dimensions. \n+\n+The `min-width` property specifies the minimum width an element can be. Even if the content inside is smaller, the element won’t shrink below this value.\n+\n+The `min-height` specifies the minimum height an element can be. It ensures that the element does not become shorter than the set value.\n+\n+Here is an example:\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <style>\n+    .box {\n+      width: 50px;\n+      min-width: 100px;\n+      height: 50px;\n+      min-height: 100px;\n+      background-color: lightcoral;\n+    }\n+  </style>\n+</head>\n+<body>\n+  <div class=\"box\"></div>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+The above example demonstrates how `min-width` and `min-height` work.\n+\n+Even though the box has its `width` and `height` set to 50px, it will actually be `100px` by `100px`. This is because the `min-width` and `min-height` are set to `100px`, which are larger than the specified `width` and `height`.\n+\n+Remember, if `min-width` or `min-height` are larger than the `width` or `height`, they will override the smaller values. This ensures that elements don't become too small, which is important for maintaining a consistent and usable design.\n+\n+The `max-width` specifies the maximum width an element can grow to, even if there is enough space for it to be wider.\n+\n+The `max-height` specifies the maximum height an element can grow to, regardless of the content size.\n+\n+Here is an example:\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <style>\n+    .box {\n+      width: 200px;\n+      max-width: 150px;\n+      height: 200px;\n+      max-height: 150px;\n+      background-color: lightgreen;\n+    }\n+  </style>\n+</head>\n+<body>\n+  <div class=\"box\"></div>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+The above example demonstrates how `max-width` and `max-height` override `width` and `height`. Even though the box is set to `200px` by `200px`, it will actually be `150px` by `150px`. This is because the `max-width` and `max-height` are set to `150px`, which is smaller.\n+\n+Remember, when `max-width` or `max-height` are smaller than `width` or `height`, they take precedence. This is important for controlling the maximum size of elements in your layouts.\n+\n+CSS prioritizes `min-width` and `min-height` over `width` and `height`. `max-width` and `max-height` restrict dimensions if values exceed their limits.\n+\n+For example, if you set `width` to `600px` and `max-width` to `500px`, the element will be limited to `500px` wide. The `max-width` overrides the wider setting, keeping the element within the specified maximum size.\n+\n+This ensures elements stay within desired size ranges, regardless of standard width and height values.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

They help in selecting elements based on their relationship to other elements, which allows for more precise and efficient styling.\n+\n+We will discuss some primary CSS combinators and their use cases, starting with the descendant combinator.\n+\n+A descendant combinator is used to target elements matched by the second selector if they are nested within an ancestor element that matches the first selector. An ancestor can be a parent element or a parent's parent.\n+\n+To better understand how this works, let's take a look at an example.\n+\n+```css\n+figure img {\n+  border: 4px solid black;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the above example, we use the descendant combinator to select all image elements inside `figure` elements and apply a `solid black` border on all four sides.\n+\n+Note that a `space` is used between the parent and child selector.\n+\n+In this case, the `figure` would be the parent and the `img` would be the child.\n+\n+If you had multiple images inside a `figure` element, using the descendant combinator would be a good way to apply a solid black border around each of those images.\n+\n+Another type of combinator would be the child combinator.\n+\n+The child combinator (`>`) in CSS is used to select elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.\n+\n+This combinator targets only elements with a specific parent, making your CSS rules more precise and preventing unintended styling of deeper nested elements.\n+\n+Let's take a look at the following HTML example:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"container\">\n+    <p>First</p>\n+    <div>\n+      <p>Second</p>\n+    </div>\n+    <div>\n+      <p>Third</p>\n+    </div>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+In above HTML structure, the `container` class is applied to a `div` element.\n+\n+Inside this container, there is a direct child `p` element (\"First\"), followed by two additional `div` elements, each containing a `p` element (\"Second\" and \"Third\").\n+\n+The first `p` element is a direct child of the `.container` element, while the other two `p` elements are nested inside other `div` elements, making them deeper descendants.\n+\n+To apply styles to just the direct child of the `container` class, you can use the child combinator like this:\n+\n+```css\n+.container > p {\n+  color: blue;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the above example, we are only targeting the direct child of `container` class. This will give the direct child the text color of `blue`.\n+\n+Because the other two paragraph elements are nested inside `div` elements, they are not considered direct children of the `container` class and will not get the text color of blue.\n+\n+Another common combinator would be the next-sibling combinator.\n+\n+The next-sibling combinator (`+`) in CSS selects an element that immediately follows a specified sibling element. This combinator is useful when you want to apply styles to an element that directly follows another element, allowing for targeted styling based on the element's position relative to its siblings.\n+\n+Let's take a look at the following HTML example:\n+\n+```html\n+<figure>\n+  <img\n+    src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\"\n+    alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\"\n+  />\n+  <figcaption>A cute orange cat lying on its back.</figcaption>\n+</figure>\n+```\n+\n+Here, we have a `figure` element containing an `img` element followed by a `figcaption` element. The `figcaption` element is the immediate sibling of the `img` element.\n+\n+If you wanted to apply a black border around the `figcaption` element, you can use the next-sibling combinator like this:\n+\n+```css\n+img + figcaption {\n+  border: 4px solid black;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this example, the next-sibling combinator (`+`) selects the `figcaption` element that immediately follows the `img` element. The applied CSS rule adds a `4px solid black border` around the `figcaption`.\n+\n+Another common combinator is the subsequent-sibling combinator.\n+\n+The subsequent-sibling combinator (`~`) in CSS selects all siblings of a specified element that come after it.\n+\n+Unlike the next-sibling combinator, which targets only the immediately following sibling, the subsequent-sibling combinator (`~`) can target any siblings that follow the specified element, offering greater flexibility in styling.\n+\n+Let's take a look at the following HTML example:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"container\">\n+  <h2>Subheading</h2>\n+  <p>First paragraph.</p>\n+  <p>Second paragraph.</p>\n+  <p>Third paragraph.</p>\n+  <p>Another paragraph element</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+In this HTML structure, we have an `h2` element followed by four paragraph elements. The paragraph elements are siblings of the `h2` element.\n+\n+If you want to style all of the paragraph elements that come after the `h2` element, then you can use the subsequent-sibling combinator like this:\n+\n+```css\n+h2 ~ p {\n+  color: green;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this example, all paragraph elements following the `h2` element will have the text color green.\n+\n+The subsequent-sibling combinator (`~`) targets all paragraph siblings that appear after the `h2` element, regardless of whether they are immediate siblings.\n+\n+In conclusion, understanding and using various CSS combinators allows you to apply precise styles to your HTML elements, enhancing the control and flexibility of your design.\n+\n+By mastering these selectors, you can create more sophisticated and targeted styling rules that improve both the appearance and functionality of your web pages.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

They always start on a new line, and their height and width can be adjusted.\n+\n+Inline elements only take up as much space as they need. They flow within the surrounding content and do not break onto a new line.\n+\n+The `inline-block` property is a hybrid of these two behaviors. Like inline elements, `inline-block` elements remain in the text flow without starting on a new line.\n+\n+However, unlike inline elements, you can adjust the width and height of an `inline-block` element, just as you would with block-level elements.\n+\n+In short, the key difference between `inline` and `inline-block` is that `inline` elements cannot have their size controlled, whereas `inline-block` elements allow for full control over dimensions while still staying inline with other content.\n+\n+Let's take a look at an example.\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"container\">\n+  <span class=\"inline-block-element element1\">Inline-Block Element 1</span>\n+  <span class=\"inline-block-element element2\">Inline-Block Element 2</span>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+In the above example, we have a `div` with a class of `container`.

Here, the `span` elements revert to their default behavior as inline elements.\n+\n+As a result, the specified width and height are ignored, and the elements only take up the space needed for their content.\n+\n+Understanding how `inline-block` works is useful because you can use it for creating layouts that require both alignment and dimension control within a continuous text flow.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

A solid black border has also been added so you can see the margins better.\n+\n+Another way to use the `margin` property is with shorthand notation. You can specify one, two, three, or four values at once. Let’s explore these options together.\n+\n+When using a singular value on the `margin` shorthand, that exact value will be applied to all four sides of the target element.\n+\n+Here is an example of using a single value on `margin` shorthand:\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  margin: 10px;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This code example will apply `10px` of `margin` equally to all four sides of the paragraph element.\n+\n+When using two values, the first value applies to the `top` and `bottom`, while the second value applies to the `left` and `right` sides of the element.\n+\n+Here is an example of using of two values for the `margin` shorthand:\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  margin: 10px 20px;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This sets the `top` and `bottom` margins to `10px`, and `20px` for the `left` and `right` margins for the paragraph element.\n+\n+If three values are provided, the first value applies to the `top` margin, the second value to the `left` and `right` margin, and the third value to the `bottom` margin.\n+\n+Here is an example to better understand:\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  margin: 10px 20px 30px;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This sets the margin to `10px` for the `top`, `20px` for the `left` and `right`, and `30px` for the `bottom`.\n+\n+When using four values, this gives you more control, as you can independently specify each margin value for each side of the target element.\n+\n+The first value targets the `top`, the second value targets the `right`, the third value targets the `bottom`, and the fourth value targets the `left`.\n+\n+Here is an example of using the margin shorthand with four values:\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This sets the margin to `10px` for the `top`, `20px` for the `right`, `30px` for the `bottom`, and `40px` for the `left`.\n+\n+The `padding` property is used to apply space inside the element, between the content and its border.\n+\n+Like the `margin` property, the four `padding` properties are `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom` and `padding-left`.\n+\n+Here's an example on how to set the `padding` for a paragraph element:\n+\n+```html\n+<span>Paragraph one</span>\n+<p>Paragraph two</p>\n+<span>Paragraph three</span>\n+```\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  padding-top: 10px;\n+  padding-right: 20px;\n+  padding-bottom: 30px;\n+  padding-left: 40px;\n+  border: 2px solid black;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This sets the padding to `10px` for the `top`, `20px` for the `right`, `30px` for the `bottom`, and `40px` for the `left`.\n+\n+As you can see that, `padding` is applied to the content which is inside the border, unlike `margin` which applies to outside the border.\n+\n+Just like the `margin` property, you can also choose to use the shorthand for the `padding` property.\n+\n+You can either specify one, two, three, or four values on the `padding` shorthand property as well.\n+\n+Here is an example of using the `padding` shorthand for paragraph element from earlier:\n+\n+```css\n+p {\n+  padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;\n+  border: 2px solid black;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the example, using the shorthand the code will set the padding to `10px` for the `top`, `20px` for the `right`, `30px` for the `bottom`, and `40px` for the `left` of the paragraph element.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

Gradients allow you to create visually appealing backgrounds without needing images.\n+\n+There are two main types of gradients in CSS: linear gradients and radial gradients.\n+\n+A linear gradient transitions colors along a straight line.

The gradient is applied to an element with a height of `60%` of the viewport height.\n+\n+Understanding how to work with CSS gradients can significantly enhance your designs by providing visually appealing backgrounds without the need for images.\n+\n+With options like linear gradients for smooth transitions and radial gradients for circular effects, they offer both flexibility and creativity in web design.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

Sufficient contrast between the background color and the text color is essential for readability.\n+\n+The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.\n+\n+For example, placing white text on a light-gray background would result in poor contrast, making the text difficult to read. However, white text on a dark-blue background would provide good contrast, enhancing readability for all users.\n+\n+Here’s an example of poor contrast:\n+\n+```html\n+<p style=\"color: lightgray; background-color: whitesmoke;\">\n+   This is an example of poor contrast.\n+</p>\n+```\n+\n+Now, here’s an example of good contrast:\n+\n+```html\n+<p style=\"color: white; background-color: darkslategray;\">\n+  This is an example of good contrast.\n+</p>\n+```\n+\n+Another consideration is avoiding placing text over busy or complex backgrounds, such as images or gradients with multiple colors. Busy backgrounds can make it hard to distinguish the text from the background, regardless of the contrast.\n+\n+If you must use a background image, it’s a good idea to apply a semi-transparent overlay or a solid color behind the text to make it more readable. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n+\n+```css\n+.background-image-text {\n+  background-image: url('fcc-logo.svg');\n+  color: white;\n+  padding: 20px;\n+  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This code places a semi-transparent black overlay behind the text, improving its readability against the background image.\n+\n+When designing backgrounds, avoid using color as the sole means of conveying information. For example, using just color to indicate an error or success message (such as red for error or green for success) can be problematic for users with color blindness.\n+\n+In addition to color, you should use symbols or text to convey information. For example, alongside a red error message, you could use an icon or bold text to make it clear that there’s an error.\n+\n+Though less common, background audio or videos can also affect accessibility.\n+\n+Background music or auto-playing videos can be distracting for some users, particularly those with cognitive disabilities. If you include background audio, always provide a way for users to mute or pause the audio.\n+\n+By taking these accessibility considerations into account, you can create more inclusive designs that ensure your content is readable and usable by all users, regardless of their abilities.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

While similar to border, outline doesn't affect the element's dimensions or layout:\n+\n+```css\n+img {\n+  outline: 3px solid gold;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This creates a gold outline around the image without changing its size or position.\n+\n+If you want to create rounded corners on your border, you can use the `border-radius` property in conjunction with border:\n+\n+```css\n+img {\n+  border: 2px solid black;\n+  border-radius: 10px;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Remember, these techniques can be combined and customized to create unique border effects. The choice of method depends on your specific design requirements and the level of complexity you need.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"
