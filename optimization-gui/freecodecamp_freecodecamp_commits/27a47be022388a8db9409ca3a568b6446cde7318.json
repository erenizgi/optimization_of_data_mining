I am going to look at the Content Division Element - or in other words, the *div*:\n+\n+```html\n+<div></div>\n+```\n+\n+I like to think of the `div` as a beautiful being that can be anything you want it to be. We can give a `div` a `height`, we can give it a `width`, and we can give it a background color using CSS - or in other words styling, which we will cover in lectures coming up.\n+\n+We can also use it in a very basic form without styling, to hold other elements together. So for example, we can create a `div` and put a heading in it, and put a paragraph in it, and now these two elements will be grouped together:\n+\n+```html\n+<div>\n+  <h1>I am a heading</h1>\n+  <p>I am a paragraph</p>\n+</div>\n+```\n+\n+Just be aware that there might be better elements to use when grouping these together. You might choose a `section` element, for example:\n+\n+```html\n+<section>\n+  <h1>I am a heading</h1>\n+  <p>I am a paragraph</p>\n+</section>\n+```\n+\n+This is because the `section` element has semantic meaning. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a `section` element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it. \n+\n+We will dive into this topic further later on. For now, just know that the `div`, does not have this. It's like a mysterious ghost. Let's see what else we can do to a `div`, in the next lecture.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

Another thing to note about `id` values, is that they cannot have spaces in them. Here is an example of applying the words `main` and `heading` to an `id` attribute value:\n+\n+```html\n+<h1 id=\"main heading\">Main heading</h1>\n+```\n+\n+Browsers will see this space as part of the `id` which will lead to unwanted issues when it comes to styling and scripting. `id` attribute values should only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.\n+\n+In contrast to the `id` attribute, the `class` attribute value does not need to be unique and can contain spaces. Here is an example of applying a class called `box` to a `div` element:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"box\"></div>\n+```\n+\n+If you wanted to add multiple class names to an element, you can do so by separating the names by a space. Here is an updated example applying multiple classes to a `div` element:\n+\n+```html\n+<div class=\"box red-box\"></div>\n+```\n+\n+To apply a set of styles to that `box` class, you can reference that class inside your CSS.

When the code runs, it will search through all of your HTML document to find all elements with that class name and apply those styles.\n+\n+So, to recap, when should you use an `id` versus a `class`? Classes are best used when you want to apply a set of styles to many elements. If you want to target a specific element, it is best to use `id` because those values need to be unique.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

It's like a ready-made template for your webpages. Think of it as the foundations of a house. A boilerplate includes the basic structure and essential elements every HTML document needs. It saves you time and helps ensure your pages are set up properly. Here is an example:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html lang=\"en\">\n+  <head>\n+    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n+    <meta\n+       name=\"viewport\"\n+       content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n+    <title>freeCodeCamp</title>\n+    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./styles.css\" />\n+  </head>\n+  <body>\n+  </body>\n+</html>\n+```\n+\n+Let's break down the key parts of this boilerplate. First, there is the `DOCTYPE` declaration:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+```\n+\n+It tells browsers which version of HTML you're using. Next, comes the `html` tag:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html lang=\"en\">\n+  <!--All other elements go inside here-->\n+</html>\n+```\n+\n+This wraps around all your content, and can specify the language of your page. Inside the `html` tag, you'll find two main sections - a `head`, and a `body`:\n+\n+```html\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html lang=\"en\">\n+  <head>\n+    <!--Important metadata goes here-->\n+  </head>\n+  <body>\n+    <!--Headings, paragraphs, images, etc. go inside here-->\n+  </body>\n+</html>\n+```\n+\n+The `head` section contains important behind-the-scenes information:\n+\n+```html\n+<head>\n+  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n+  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n+  <title>Document Title Goes Here</title>\n+  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./styles.css\" />\n+</head>\n+```\n+\n+Your site's metadata, contained in `meta` elements, has details about things like character encoding, and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link. Your site's title, found in the `title` element, determines the text that appears in the browser tab or window. Finally, you'll typically link your page's external stylesheets in the `head` section using `link` elements.\n+\n+The `body` section is where all your content goes:\n+\n+```html\n+<body>\n+  <h1>I am a main title</h1>\n+  <p>Example paragraph text</p>\n+</body>\n+```\n+\n+This is what visitors actually see on your web page.\n+\n+Now, why is a boilerplate important? It ensures your pages are structured correctly and work well across different browsers. Using a boilerplate helps you avoid common mistakes and follow best practices. It's a great starting point for any web project. Remember, you can customize your own boilerplate to fit your needs. As you gain experience, you might add your own preferred elements or `meta` tags. As you continue to improve your personal boilerplate, you'll find that it saves you time when starting new projects.\n+\n+Next time you start a new HTML file, consider using a boilerplate. It will definitely give you a solid foundation to build on.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data. Essentially, all text on a web page is a sequence of characters stored as one or more bytes. In computing, a byte is a unit of data consisting of 8 bits, or binary digits. UTF-8 supports every character in the Unicode character set - and this includes characters and symbols from all writing systems, languages, and technical symbols. Here is an example of using the `meta` element with the `charset` attribute to set the character encoding to `UTF-8`:\n+\n+```html\n+<meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n+```\n+\n+By setting the character encoding to UTF-8, it will ensure that the accented `\"e\"` character (`é`) is displayed correctly on the page.

One way to improve your site's SEO, is to provide a short description for the web page using the `meta` element. Here is an example of using the meta element to set a page description for a gardening site:\n+\n+```html\n+<meta\n+  name=\"description\"\n+  content=\"Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden.\"\n+/>\n+```\n+\n+By setting the `name` attribute to `description`, it ensures that browsers, search engines, and other web tools correctly interpret this metadata. The `content` attribute is where you will place your description. It is recommended that you keep your descriptions short and concise. This is because search engines will often truncate the description based on the results page layout.\n+\n+Similar to other types of `meta` elements, the `meta` description will not be visible on the web page itself. One place where the page description can be found is in the search engine results page snippet. Here are some examples of page result snippets for freeCodeCamp's subreddit and GitHub repositories:\n+\n+```sh\n+r\\FreeCodeCamp: This is the official subreddit for the freeCodeCamp.org community. Learn to\n+code for free together with millions of other people...\n+```\n+\n+```sh\n+Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-\n+paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you...\n+```\n+\n+In the examples, each of the page descriptions are located just beneath the site links. Within a couple of seconds, users can get a general sense of what the page is about and decide to click on the links for more information.\n+\n+Even though `meta` descriptions won't directly affect a site's ranking on search engine, having a strong description could result in more traffic to your website.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"

By setting these open graph properties, you can entice users to want to click and engage with your content. You can set these properties through a collection of `meta` elements inside your HTML `head` section.\n+\n+The first important OG property to include would be the `title`. Here is an example of setting the OG `title` for the freeCodeCamp homepage:\n+\n+```html\n+<meta content=\"freeCodeCamp.org\" property=\"og:title\" />\n+```\n+\n+For the `name` attribute, you will need to specify that it is `og:title`. The `content` attribute is where you will write the title you want displayed for social media sites.\n+\n+The next important OG property would be the `type`. Here is an example of using the OG `type` for the freeCodeCamp homepage:\n+\n+```html\n+<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\n+```\n+\n+The `type` property is used to represent the type of content being shared on social media.

All of these images should be high quality with good dimensions and ratios. Most social media platforms will include criteria for image requirements to help you ensure that your content displays well on their site. For example, the developers.facebook.com documentation page states:\n+\n+\"use images that are at least 1200 by 630 pixels for the best display on high resolution devices. At the minimum, you should use images that are 600 by 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images.\"\n+\n+The fourth important OG property would be the `url`. Here is an example of setting the OG `url` for the freeCodeCamp homepage:\n+\n+```html\n+<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org\" />\n+```\n+\n+There are many more OG properties that you can set, like `description`, `audio`, `video` and `locale`. However, the open graph `url`, `image`, `type`, and `title` are the most important ones to include.\n+\n+So how do these open graph properties affect Search Engine Optimization? When your content is shared on social media, well-crafted OG properties can enhance the appearance for your content in users' feeds. This can lead to higher click-through rates which could signal to search engines that your content is relevant and engaging.\n+\n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--"
