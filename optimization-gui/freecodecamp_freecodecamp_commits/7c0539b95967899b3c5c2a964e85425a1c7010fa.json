All the fonts that belong to the same family are based on the same core typeface, but they also have variations in their style, weight, and width. You can think of them as siblings who share similar characteristics but also have some differences. For example, Arial is a font family that includes variations like Arial Bold and Arial Italic.\n \n-In CSS, you can set the font family with the `font-family` property. That is, you write the property followed by a colon, a space, and the font family that will be assigned:\n+In CSS, you can set the font family with the `font-family` property.

You can specify multiple font families in order of priority, from highest to lowest, by separating them with commas. These alternative fonts will act as fallback options. In this example, Arial is a primary font and Lato is an alternative font:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n+```html\n+<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n+<p id=\"specified-font\">Example paragraph using specified fonts.</p>\n+<p>Paragraph not using specified fonts.</p>\n+```\n+\n ```css\n-font-family: Arial, Lato;\n+#specified-font {\n+  font-family: Arial, Lato;\n+}\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The browser will render the first font (Arial) if it's found on the device. If not, the second font (Lato) will be rendered.\n \n You should also know how this process works behind the scenes. The selection process doesn't stop if the first font is available. The font family is chosen one character at a time, so if a font lacks a specific character, the browser looks for it in the lower-priority fonts.

If Arial is not found, then the browser will try to render Lato. If neither is found, the browser will use the generic sans-serif font family, selecting a font with these characteristics from those installed on the user's system.\n \n You should always include a generic font family at the end of the font-family list. Keep in mind that the generic font may look different from the font that you originally envisioned in your design, so it's always helpful to check how these fallback fonts look on different browsers."
