Its output depends only on its input, and it doesn't modify any external state.\n+- Impure functions have side effects, which are changes to the state of the program that are observable outside the function.\n+\n+## Functional programming\n+\n+- Functional Programming is an approach to software development that emphasizes the use of functions to solve problems, focusing on what needs to be done rather than how to do it.\n+- Functional programming encourages the use of techniques that help avoid side effects, such as using immutable data structures and higher-order functions. \n+- When used correctly, functional programming principles lead to cleaner and more maintainable code\n+\n+## Currying\n+\n+- Currying is a functional programming technique that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.\n+\n+Here is an example of a regualr function vs a curried function:\n+\n+```js\n+// Regular function\n+\n+function average(a, b, c) {\n+  return (a + b + c) / 3;\n+}\n+\n+// Curried function\n+\n+function curriedAverage(a) {\n+  return function(b) {\n+    return function(c) {\n+      return (a + b + c) / 3;\n+    };\n+  };\n+}\n+\n+// Usage of curried function\n+\n+const avg = curriedAverage(2)(3)(4);\n+```\n+\n+- Currying can be particularly powerful when working with functions that take many arguments.\n+- Currying makes your code more flexible and easier to reuse.\n+- You can use arrow functions to create curried functions more concisely:\n+\n+```js\n+const curriedAverage = a => b => c => (a + b + c) / 3;\n+```\n+\n+- While currying can lead to more flexible and reusable code, it can also make code harder to read if overused. \n \n # --assignment--\n "
