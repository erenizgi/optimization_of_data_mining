While basic arithmetic operators can handle simple calculations, JavaScript offers a built-in `Math` object to tackle more complex math challenges.\n \n This handy tool provides a variety of methods that make it easier to perform advanced calculations and manipulate numbers. Let's explore these methods and see how they can simplify your coding experience.\n \n The `Math.random()` method generates a random floating-point number between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive). This means the possible output can be `0`, but it will never actually reach `1`. Here is an example working with the `Math.random()` method:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const randomNum = Math.random();\n \n-console.log(randomNum); \n+console.log(randomNum);\n // any number between 0 and 1 – 0 inclusive and 1 exclusive\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `Math.min()` and `Math.max()` both take a set of numbers and return the minimum and maximum value, respectively. Here is an example of working both of those methods:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const smallest = Math.min(1, 5, 3, 9);\n console.log(smallest); // 1\n@@ -30,69 +36,110 @@ const largest = Math.max(1, 5, 3, 9);\n console.log(largest); // 9\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The first `console.log()` will log the number `1`, since `1` is the smallest in that list of numbers. And the second `console.log()` will log the number `9`, since `9` is the largest numbers in that list.\n \n If you wanted to round numbers up or down to the nearest whole integer, you could use the `Math.ceil()` and `Math.floor()` methods.  Here is an example of working with `Math.ceil()`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Math.ceil(4.3)); // 5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `Math.ceil()` will round `4.3` up to the nearest whole integer, which is `5` in this case. Now, let's take a look at rounding a number down:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Math.floor(4.7)); // 4\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `Math.floor()` will round `4.7` down to the nearest whole integer, which is `4` in this case. `Math.round()` is the hybrid of `Math.ceil()` and `Math.floor()`. It rounds a number to its nearest integer, taking the decimal point into account:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Math.round(2.3)); // 2\n console.log(Math.round(4.5)); // 5\n console.log(Math.round(4.8)); // 5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n So, if the decimal point is less than `5`, the number is rounded down. And if the decimal point is `5` or greater, the number is rounded up. A practical application of `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` is to generate a random number between two whole numbers. Here's the syntax for that:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n-Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;\n+const max = 10;\n+const min = 5;\n+const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;\n+console.log(randomNum);\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Generating a random number between `20` and `1` would look like this:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const randomNumBtw1And20 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1;\n-console.log(randomNumBtw1And20); \n+console.log(randomNumBtw1And20);\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Another helpful `Math` method would be the `Math.trunc()` method. `Math.trunc()` removes the decimal part of a number, returning only the integer portion, without rounding:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Math.trunc(2.9)); // 2\n console.log(Math.trunc(9.1)); // 9\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n If you need to get the square root or cube root of a number, you can use the `Math.sqrt()` and `Math.cbrt()` methods, respectively:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Math.sqrt(81)); // 9\n console.log(Math.cbrt(27)); // 3\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The first log statement, will log `9` because the square root of `81` is `9`, while the second log statement will log `3` because the cube root of `27` is `3`. If you need to get the absolute value of a number, you can use the `Math.abs()` method:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Math.abs(-5)); // 5\n console.log(Math.abs(5)); // 5\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, turning negatives into positives. The last method we will look at will be the `Math.pow()` method:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(Math.pow(2, 3)); // 8\n console.log(Math.pow(8, 2)); // 64\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `Math.pow()` takes two numbers and raise the first to the power of the second. There are many more methods that belong to the `Math` object, that you can explore on your own. However, these are just a few of the more commonly used ones found in JavaScript codebases.\n \n # --questions--"
