This is particularly important for the main text of your website. Users are more likely to engage with your content if the font is easy to read. You should use two or three fonts at most to create a visual consistency. Using too many fonts can make the text more difficult to read and weaken your brand's identity. This can also impact the user experience by increasing the load time of the website. You can use font size to create a visual hierarchy for headings, subheadings, paragraphs, and other elements.
