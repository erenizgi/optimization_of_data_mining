That's exactly what the `this` keyword is used for. It refers to the context where the code is supposed to run. If you use it within a method, the value of `this` will be a reference to the object associated to that method. This way, you can access the properties and methods of the object within the class and reuse the method on different objects.\n \n@@ -64,12 +64,29 @@ If we call the `.showPrice()` method on this object:\n brownie.showPrice();\n ```\n \n-Here is the output:\n+Here is the full example:\n+\n+:::interactive_editor\n \n ```js\n-The price of Brownie is $5.99.\n+class Dessert {\n+  constructor(name, price) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.price = price;\n+  }\n+\n+  showPrice() {\n+    console.log(`The price of ${this.name} is $${this.price}.`);\n+  }\n+}\n+\n+const brownie = new Dessert(\"Brownie\", 5.99);\n+brownie.showPrice();\n+console.log(brownie);\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The name and price of the current object (`brownie`) are replaced in the string.\n \n This is all thanks to the `this` keyword, which gives you a general way to refer to the current object within the class.
