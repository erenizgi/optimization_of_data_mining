This approach can lead to faster, more responsive applications, but it also comes with a set of challenges and considerations.\n \n SPAs heavily use JavaScript to manage the application's state and render content. Instead of requesting new HTML pages from the server, SPAs use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and fetch data asynchronously. This is often done using libraries and frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, which provide great tools for building complex user interfaces."

This means that instead of writing styles as you would in a CSS file, you create a JavaScript object where the keys are camel cased versions of CSS property names, and the values are the strings of CSS values."
