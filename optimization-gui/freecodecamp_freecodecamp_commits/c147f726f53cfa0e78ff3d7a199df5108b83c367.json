The `grid-auto-flow` property controls this behavior, using values like `row`, `column`, or `dense` to influence the placement direction and whether empty gaps are backfilled.\n - **Line-based Placement**: All grids have lines. To specify where the item begins on a line, you can use the `grid-column-start` and `grid-row-start` properties. To specify where the item ends on the line, you can use the `grid-column-end` and `grid-row-end` properties. You can also choose to use the `grid-column` or `grid-row` shorthand properties instead.\n - **`grid-template-areas`**: This property is used to provide a name for the items you are going to position on the grid. \n+- **Alignment:** Use `justify-items` and `align-items` to control how items are aligned within their grid areas. Use `justify-self` and `align-self` on individual grid items to override the alignment set on the container.\n \n ## CSS Animation Basics \n "
