It determines where variables can be accessed or modified. In JavaScript, understanding scope is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and bug-free code. There are three main types of scope: global scope, local scope, and block scope.\n \n Global scope is the outermost scope in a JavaScript program. Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code, including within functions and blocks. These variables are often called global variables. While global variables can be convenient, they should be used sparingly as they can lead to naming conflicts and make your code harder to maintain. Here's an example of a global variable:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let globalVar = \"I'm a global variable\";\n \n function printGlobalVar() {\n     console.log(globalVar);\n }\n \n-printGlobalVar(); // Output: \"I'm a global variable\"\n+printGlobalVar(); // \"I'm a global variable\"\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, `globalVar` is declared in the global scope and can be accessed inside the `printGlobalVar` function.\n \n Local scope, on the other hand, refers to variables that are only accessible within a function. Here's an example of local scope:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n function greet() {\n     let message = \"Hello, local scope!\";\n     console.log(message);\n }\n \n-greet(); // Output: \"Hello, local scope!\"\n-console.log(message); // This will throw an error\n+greet(); // \"Hello, local scope!\"\n+// console.log(message); // This will throw an error\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this code, `message` is a local variable within the `greet` function. It can be used inside the function, but trying to access it outside the function will result in an error.\n \n Block scope is a concept introduced with the `let` and `const` keywords in ES6. A block is any code section within curly braces, `{}`, such as in `if` statements, `for` loops, or `while` loops. The concept of loops will be taught in an upcoming lesson. \n@@ -44,7 +52,7 @@ Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block are only accessible with\n ```js\n if (true) {\n     let blockVar = \"I'm in a block\";\n-    console.log(blockVar); // Output: \"I'm in a block\"\n+    console.log(blockVar); // \"I'm in a block\"\n }\n console.log(blockVar); // This will throw an error\n ```"
