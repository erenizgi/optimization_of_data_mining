This means it tries to convert the operands to the same type before making the comparison. In this case, `null` and `undefined` are considered equal:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(null == undefined); // true\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n However, when using the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks both value and type without performing type coercion, `null` and `undefined` are not equal:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(null === undefined); // false\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This difference is important to keep in mind when writing conditional statements or performing equality checks in your code. When comparing `null` or `undefined` with other values using the equality operator (`==`), the behavior can be unexpected. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(null == 0);  // false\n console.log(null == ''); // false\n console.log(undefined == 0); // false\n console.log(undefined == ''); // false\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n These comparisons return `false` because `null` and `undefined` are only equal to each other (and themselves) when using the equality operator. The behavior of `null` in other comparisons is particularly tricky:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(null > 0);  // false\n console.log(null == 0); // false\n console.log(null >= 0); // true\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n `undefined`, on the other hand, always converts to `NaN` in numeric contexts, which makes all numeric comparisons with `undefined` return `false`:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n console.log(undefined > 0);  // false\n console.log(undefined < 0);  // false\n console.log(undefined == 0); // false\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Given these nuances, it's generally recommended to use the strict equality operator when comparing values, especially when dealing with `null` and `undefined`. This approach helps avoid unexpected type coercion and makes your code's behavior more predictable.\n \n In summary, while `null` and `undefined` are both used to represent the absence of a value, they behave differently in comparisons. Understanding these differences is key to writing clear and error-free JavaScript code."
