Let's look at the three most common binary logical operators: logical AND, logical OR, and the nullish coalescing operator.\n \n The logical AND operator is represented by a double ampersand (`&&`). It checks if both operands are true and returns a result. If both operands are truthy, it returns the second value, that is, the one on the right:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = true && 'hello';\n \n console.log(result); // hello\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In the example above, the text `hello` is logged to the console because both operands are `true`. If either operand is falsy, it returns the falsy value:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = 0 && 3;\n \n console.log(result); // 0\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Since `0` is a falsy value, the number `0` is logged to the console. And if both operands are falsy, it returns the first falsy value:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = false && 0;\n \n console.log(result); // false\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Since `false` is a falsy value, then `false` is logged to the console. The logical AND operator is useful when you want to check multiple conditions and ensure that all are true before proceeding. Here is an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n if (2 < 3 && 3 < 4) {\n  console.log('The if block runs'); \n@@ -43,26 +57,38 @@ if (2 < 3 && 3 < 4) {\n } \n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In the condition, since `2` is less than `3` AND `3` is less than `4`, then the sentence `The if block runs` will be logged to the console.\n \n The logical OR operator checks if at least one of the operands is truthy. If the first operand is truthy, it returns that value:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = 'This is truthy' || false;\n \n console.log(result); // This is truthy\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n If the first operand is falsy but the second is truthy, the second value will be logged to the console:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n const result = 0 || 'This is truthy';\n \n console.log(result); // This is truthy\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n It is common to use the logical OR operator in `if/else` statements like this:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let userInput;\n \n@@ -73,6 +99,8 @@ if (userInput || 'Guest') {\n }\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Since we didn't assign a value to the `userInput` variable, it is currently `undefined`. The condition in the `if` statement checks if either the `userInput` variable or the string `Guest` are truthy. Since the string `Guest` is true in a boolean context like this, the string `A user is present` will be logged to the console.\n \n The nullish coalescing operator is more sophisticated than logical OR and logical AND. Represented by a double question mark (`??`), it helps in scenarios where you want to return a value only if the first one is `null` or `undefined`. Here is an example of working with the nullish coalescing operator:"
