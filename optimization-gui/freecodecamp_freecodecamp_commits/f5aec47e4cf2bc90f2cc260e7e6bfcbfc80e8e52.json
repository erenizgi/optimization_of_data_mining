Then, the `while` loop first checks if the `userInput` is `NaN`. Remember that `NaN` is \"Not a Number\". `isNaN` checks whether the value is `NaN` and that `NaN` is the result of an invalid number conversion because it's not a number.\n-\n-So if the user types in random characters or nothing at all, then they will be prompted with the message again. The `while` loop is also checking if the `userInput`, when converted to a number, is between `1` and `10`. \n-\n-We are using the `Number` constructor here because a prompt will return a string and we want only want to be explicitly checking numbers here.\n+:::\n \n-If the user input is not between `1` and `10`, the `while` loop will continue to prompt the user to enter a number between `1` and `10`.\n-\n-Once the user enters a valid number, the `while` loop will exit and an alert will be displayed to the user.\n+In this example, we have a variable called `counter` that is initialized to `0`.
