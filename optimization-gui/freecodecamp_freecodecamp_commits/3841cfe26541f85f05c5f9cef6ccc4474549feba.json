You could use a loop to print out each one of the items in the list.\n+\n+Another example would be when you designing a game and you want to move a character across the screen. You could use a loop to move the character a certain number of pixels each time the loop runs. \n+\n+In JavaScript, there are several types of loops that you can use. In this video, we will cover the `for` loop. Here is the basic syntax for a `for` loop:\n+\n+```js\n+for (initialization; condition; increment or decrement) {\n+  // code block to be executed\n+}\n+```\n+\n+The initialization statement is executed before the loop starts. It is typically used to initialize a counter variable. A counter variable is a variable that is used to keep track of how many times the loop has run.\n+\n+The condition statement is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. An iteration is a single pass through the loop.\n+\n+If the condition is true, the code block inside the loop is executed. If the condition is false, the loop stops and you move on to the next block of code.\n+\n+The last part of the loop is the increment/decrement statement. This statement is executed after each iteration of the loop. It is typically used to increment or decrement the counter variable.\n+\n+```js\n+for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n+  console.log(i);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the first part of the example above, we initialize a counter variable `i` to `0`. It is common convention to use `i` as the counter variable in a `for` loop.\n+\n+The next part is to check the condition. In this case, the condition is checking if `i` is less than `5`. Since `i` is `0`, the condition is true, and the code block inside the loop is executed.\n+\n+The code block inside the loop is to log the value of `i` to the console. The value of `i` is `0`, so the console will show the value of `0`.\n+\n+Then the increment statement is executed. In this case, we are incrementing `i` by `1`. So `i` is now `1`.\n+\n+Then we check the condition again which is to check if `i` is less than `5`. Since `i` is now `1`, the condition is still true, and the code block inside the loop is executed again.\n+\n+We keep repeating this process until the condition is false. In this case, when `i` is `5`, the condition is false, and the loop stops.\n+\n+When you're working with loops you should be careful not to create a condition that is always true. If you do, the loop will run forever and your program will crash. This is known as an infinite loop.\n+\n+It is possible to create nested `for` loops. A nested loop is when you place one loop inside of another. We will see examples of when you might want to do this later on.\n+\n+Loops can be beneficial in programming when you need to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. Even though working with `for` loops can be tricky at first,  with practice you will get the hang of it.\n \n # --questions--\n \n@@ -86,7 +136,7 @@ The loop will run forever and may cause the program to crash.\n \n ## --text--\n \n-In the following for loop example, what will be the output?\n+In the following `for` loop example, what will be the output?\n \n ```js\n for (let i = 2; i <= 6; i += 2) {"

If you have a string, the variable would be the current character in the string.\n+\n+Let's take a look at a few examples so you can better understand how the `for...of` loop works.\n+\n+In this first example we have an array of numbers and we want to loop over each number and log it to the console.\n+\n+```js\n+const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n+\n+for (const num of numbers) {\n+  console.log(num);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+We have created a variable called `num` that will represent the current number in the array.

If it does, you will get an error.\n+\n+Here is an example of using `const` that results in an error:\n+\n+```js\n+const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n+\n+for (const num of numbers) {\n+  console.log(num);\n+  num = num + 1; // This will cause an error\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we are trying to change the value of `num` inside the loop. Since we declared `num` with `const`, we will get an error. So, if you need to change the value of the variable inside the loop, use `let` instead.\n+\n+Let's take a look at one last example dealing with an array of objects.\n+\n+```js\n+const people = [\n+  { name: 'John', age: 30 },\n+  { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },\n+  { name: 'Jim', age: 40 }\n+];\n+\n+for (const person of people) {\n+  console.log(`${person.name} is ${person.age} years old`);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this example, the we have an array of objects called `people`. Each object has a `name` and `age` property.\n+\n+When we loop through the array, we create a variable called `person` that will represent the current object in the array.\n+\n+Inside the loop, we are outputting a message to the console.\n+\n+The first message will be `John is 30 years old`, the second message will be `Jane is 25 years old`, and the third message will be `Jim is 40 years old`.\n+\n+`for...of` loops are really useful when you need to loop over values from an iterable like an array or a string. They also usually easy to read and can make your code more concise.\n \n # --questions--\n "

If the condition is false, the block of code will not be executed.\n+\n+`while` loops are useful when you do not know how many times you need to run the block of code.

Then, the `while` loop first checks if the `userInput` is `NaN`. Remember that `NaN` is \"Not a Number\". `isNaN` checks whether the value is `NaN` and that `NaN` is the result of an invalid number conversion because it's not a number.\n+\n+So if the user types in random characters or nothing at all, then they will be prompted with the message again. The `while` loop is also checking if the `userInput`, when converted to a number, is between `1` and `10`. \n+\n+We are using the `Number` constructor here because a prompt will return a string and we want only want to be explicitly checking numbers here.\n+\n+If the user input is not between `1` and `10`, the `while` loop will continue to prompt the user to enter a number between `1` and `10`.\n+\n+Once the user enters a valid number, the `while` loop will exit and an alert will be displayed to the user.\n+\n+Another loop similar to the `while` loop would be the `do...while` loop.

If the condition is false, the block of code will stop executing.\n+\n+Here is an example of using a `do...while` loop to validate user input:\n+\n+```js\n+let userInput;\n+\n+do {\n+  userInput = prompt(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10\");\n+} while (Number(userInput) < 1 || Number(userInput) > 10);\n+\n+alert(\"You entered a valid number!\");\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we have a variable called `userInput` and have not assigned a value to it. Then we have a `do...while` loop that will prompt the user to enter a number between `1` and `10`.\n+\n+Then the `while` loop will check if the user input is less `than` 1 or greater than `10`. If the input is not between `1` and `10`, the `do...while` loop will continue to prompt the user to enter a number between `1` and `10`.\n+\n+Once the user complies and enters a valid number, the `do...while` loop will exit and an alert will be displayed to the user.\n+\n+In most cases, you will probably use the `while` loop more often than the `do...while` loop.

Here is an example of using a `continue` statement in a `for` loop:\n+\n+```js\n+for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n+  if (i === 5) {\n+    continue;\n+  }\n+  console.log(i);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Just like before, we have initialized `i` to `0` and have a condition that will run the loop as long as `i` is less than `10`.\n+\n+Inside the loop, when `i` is equal to `5`, we use the `continue` statement to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.\n+\n+The output of this code will print the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`. The number `5` is skipped because of the `continue` statement.\n+\n+Another thing you can do with both the `break` and `continue` statements is to use labels to specify which loop you want to break or continue.\n+\n+This is useful when you have nested loops and you want to control the flow of the outer loop from within the inner loop.\n+\n+Here is an example of using labels with the `break` statement:\n+\n+```js\n+outerLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n+  innerLoop: for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\n+    if (i === 1 && j === 1) {\n+      break outerLoop;\n+    }\n+    console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we have an outer `for` loop labeled `outerLoop` and an inner `for` loop labeled `innerLoop`.\n+\n+When `i` is equal to `1` and `j` is equal to `1`, we use the `break` statement with the `outerLoop` label to exit the outer loop early. This will exit both the inner and outer loops.\n+\n+The output of this code will log the following to the console:\n+\n+```md\n+\"i: 0, j: 0\"\n+\"i: 0, j: 1\"\n+\"i: 0, j: 2\"\n+\"i: 1, j: 0\"\n+```\n+\n+Most of the time you will not find the need to use labels with the `break` and `continue` statements, but it is good to know that you have that option if you ever need it.\n \n # --questions--\n \n@@ -110,7 +182,7 @@ Labels are used to control the flow of execution in nested loops.\n \n ---\n \n-To allow multiple break and continue statements within the same loop.\n+To allow multiple break and `continue` statements within the same loop.\n \n ### --feedback--\n "
