These elements flow within the content, allowing text and other inline elements to appear alongside them. Common inline elements are `span`, `anchor`, and `img` elements.\n-- **Block Level Elements**: Block level elements that take up the full width available to them by default, stretching across the width of their container.

It overrides any internal or external CSS. The specificity value for inline styles is (1, 0, 0, 0).\n - **Internal CSS Specificity**: Internal CSS is defined within a `style` element in the `head` section of the HTML document. It has lower specificity than inline styles but can override external styles.\n - **External CSS Specificity**: External CSS is linked via a `link` element in the `head` section and is written in separate `.css` files. It has the lowest specificity but provides the best maintainability for larger projects. \n-- **Universal Selector (`*`)**: a special type of CSS selector that matches any element in the document. It is often used to apply a style to all elements on the page, which can be useful for resetting or normalizing styles across different browsers.

Type selectors have a relatively low specificity compared to other selectors. The specificity value for a type selector is (0, 0, 0, 1). \n - **Class Selectors**: These selectors are defined by a period (`.`) followed by the class name. The specificity value for a class selector is (0, 0, 1, 0). This means that class selectors can override type selectors, but they can be overridden by ID selectors and inline styles.\n - **ID Selectors**: ID selectors are defined by a hash symbol (`#`) followed by the ID name.
