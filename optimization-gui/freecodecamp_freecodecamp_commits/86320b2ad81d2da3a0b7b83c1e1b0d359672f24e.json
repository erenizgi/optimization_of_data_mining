This demonstrates how Grid can create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.\n \n Both Flexbox and Grid offer significant advantages over older layout methods like floats or table-based layouts. They provide more flexibility and control, require less code, and are designed with responsiveness in mind. They allow developers to create complex, responsive layouts with relative ease, making them invaluable tools in implementing responsive web design."
