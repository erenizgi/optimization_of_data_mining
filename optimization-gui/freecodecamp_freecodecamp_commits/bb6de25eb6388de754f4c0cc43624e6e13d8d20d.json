We provide two callback functions: one for handling errors, and another for when the database is successfully opened. The `db` object we get in the success callback is what we'll use to interact with the database.\n \n If you check the browser dev tools application interface, you will see your `Sample DB` in the `IndexedDb` section has been opened. Once you have your database open, you can start working with object stores.\n \n Object stores in IndexedDB are similar to tables in traditional databases. They hold the actual data you want to store.
