Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the code and are called global variables.\n+- **Local scope**: This is refers to variables declared within a function. These variables are only accessible within the function where they are declared and are called local variables.\n+- **Block scope**: A block is a set of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}` such as in `if` statements, or loops.\n+- Block scoping with `let` and `const` provides even finer control over variable accessibility, helping to prevent errors and make your code more predictable.\n \n # --assignment--\n "
