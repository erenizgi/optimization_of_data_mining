The MIME type can tell an application, such as your browser, how to handle a specific file. In the case of audio and video, the MIME type indicates it is a multimedia format that can be embedded in the web page.\n - **`source` Element**: This is used to specify a file type and source - and can include multiple different types by using multiple source elements. When you do this, the browser will determine the best format to use for the user's current environment.\n-- **MP3**: This is a type of digital file format used to store music, audio, or sound. It's a compressed version of a sound recording that makes the file size smaller, so it's easier to store and share. An MP3 file has the MIME type audio/mp3\n-- **MP4**: An MP4 is a type of digital file format used to store video and audio. It serves as a container that holds both the video (images) and the sound (music or speech) in one file. An MP4, can have the MIME type audio/mp4 OR video/mp4, depending on whether it's a video file or audio-only. \n+- **MP3**: This is a type of digital file format used to store music, audio, or sound. It's a compressed version of a sound recording that makes the file size smaller, so it's easier to store and share. MP3 has the widest browser support and the MIME type of `audio/mp3`.\n+- **MP4**: An MP4 is a type of digital file format used to store video and audio. It serves as a container that holds both the video (images) and the sound (music or speech) in one file. An MP4, can have the MIME type `audio/mp4` OR `video/mp4`, depending on whether it's a video file or audio-only.\n+- Other formats are `WMV` which is associated with the Windows Media Player app, `OGG`, `MKV`, `AVI`, and more.\n \n ## codecs\n \n - **Definition**: A codec, short for \"encoder/decoder\", is an algorithm or software that can convert audio and video between analogue and digital formats. Codecs can be specified as part of the MIME type. The basic syntax to define a codec is to add a semi-colon after the media type, then `codecs=` and the codec.\n \n ## HTMLMediaElement API\n \n-- **Definition**: The `HTMLMediaElement` API is used to control the behavior of audio and video elements on your page. It extends the base `HTMLElement` interface, so you have access to the base properties as well as these helpful methods. Examples of these methods include `play()`, `fastSeek()`, and `pause()`.\n+- **Definition**: The `HTMLMediaElement` API is used to control the behavior of audio and video elements on your page.
