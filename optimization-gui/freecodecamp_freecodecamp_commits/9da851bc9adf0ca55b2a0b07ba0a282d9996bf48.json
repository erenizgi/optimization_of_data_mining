You should declare an empty array named `inventory` that will store product objects having a key `name` with the value of a lowercase string, and a key `quantity` with the value of an integer.\n 1. You should create a function named `findProductIndex` that takes the product name as its argument and returns the index of the corresponding product object inside the `inventory` array. The function should always use the lowercase form of the product name to perform the search. If the product is not found, the function should return `-1`.\n 1. You should create a function named `addProduct` that takes a product object as its argument.\n-1. If the product is already present in the inventory, the `addProduct` function should update its `quantity` value and log to the console the product name followed by a space and `quantity updated`.\n+1. If the product is already present in the inventory, the `addProduct` function should update its `quantity` value by adding the quantity passed in to the function to the current `quantity` and log to the console the product name followed by a space and `quantity updated`.\n 1. If the product is not present in the inventory, the `addProduct` function should push the product to the `inventory` array and log the product name to the console, followed by a space and `added to inventory`.\n 1.

The `removeProduct` function should subtract the passed quantity from the corresponding product object inside the inventory and log the string `Remaining <product-name> pieces: <product-quantity>` to the console, where `<product-name>` should be replaced by the product name, and `<product-quantity>` should be replaced by the product quantity."
