These operators perform operations on th\n \n The bitwise AND (`&`) operator returns a `1` in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are `1`. Here's an example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let a = 5;  // Binary: 101\n let b = 3;  // Binary: 011\n-console.log(a & b);  // Output: 1 (Binary: 001)\n+console.log(a & b);  // 1 (Binary: 001)\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n In this example, we perform a bitwise AND operation on `5` (`101` in binary) and `3` (`011` in binary). The result is `1` (`001` in binary) because only the rightmost bit is `1` in both numbers.\n \n The bitwise OR (`|`) operator returns a `1` in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either or both operands are `1`. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let a = 5;  // Binary: 101\n let b = 3;  // Binary: 011\n-console.log(a | b);  // Output: 7 (Binary: 111)\n+console.log(a | b);  // 7 (Binary: 111)\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, the result is `7` (`111` in binary) because at least one of the bits is `1` in each position.\n \n The bitwise XOR (`^`) operator returns a `1` in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either, but not both, operands are `1`. For instance:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let a = 5;  // Binary: 101\n let b = 3;  // Binary: 011\n-console.log(a ^ b);  // Output: 6 (Binary: 110)\n+console.log(a ^ b);  // 6 (Binary: 110)\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n The result is `6` (`110` in binary) because the first and second bits from the right are different in the two numbers.\n \n The bitwise NOT (`~`) operator inverts all the bits of its operand. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let a = 5;  // Binary: 101\n-console.log(~a);  // Output: -6\n+console.log(~a);  // -6\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n This might seem surprising, but it's because of how negative numbers are represented in binary using two's complement.\n \n The left shift (`<<`) operator shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let a = 5;  // Binary: 101\n-console.log(a << 1);  // Output: 10 (Binary: 1010)\n+console.log(a << 1);  // 10 (Binary: 1010)\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, all bits are shifted one position to the left, effectively multiplying the number by `2`.\n \n The right shift (`>>`) operator shifts all bits to the right. For example:\n \n+:::interactive_editor\n+\n ```js\n let a = 5;  // Binary: 101\n-console.log(a >> 1);  // Output: 2 (Binary: 10)\n+console.log(a >> 1);  // 2 (Binary: 10)\n ```\n \n+:::\n+\n Here, all bits are shifted one position to the right, effectively dividing the number by `2` and rounding down.\n \n Bitwise operators are often used in low-level programming and cryptography.
