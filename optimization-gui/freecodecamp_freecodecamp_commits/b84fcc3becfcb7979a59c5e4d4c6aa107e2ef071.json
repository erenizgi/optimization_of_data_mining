You have retrieved the `healthText` and `goldText` elements in a prior step.\n \n After your assignment lines, assign the `innerText` property of `goldText` to be the variable `gold`. Use the same pattern to update `healthText` with the `health` variable.\n \n-Here is an example:\n-\n-```js\n-let value = 100;\n-const total = document.querySelector('#total');\n-total.innerText = value;\n-```\n-\n You can test this by clicking your `\"Go to store\"` button, followed by your `\"Buy Health\"` button.\n \n **Note:** Your answer should only be two lines of code."
