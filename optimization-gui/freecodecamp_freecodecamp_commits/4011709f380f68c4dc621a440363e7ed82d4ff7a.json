Similar to JavaScript, lists are mutable and use zero-based indexing, meaning that the first element of the list is at index zero.\n+\n+Here is the basic syntax for a list:\n+\n+```py\n+cities = ['Los Angeles', 'London', 'Tokyo']\n+```\n+\n+To access an element from the `cities` list, you can reference its index number in the sequence. Here is an example of accessing the first element of the `cities` list:\n+\n+```py\n+cities = ['Los Angeles', 'London', 'Tokyo']\n+cities[0] # 'Los Angeles'\n+```\n+\n+Negative indexing is used to access elements starting from the end of the list instead of the beginning at index `0`. To access the last element of any list, you can use `-1` like this:\n+\n+```py\n+cities = ['Los Angeles', 'London', 'Tokyo']\n+cities[-1] # 'Tokyo'\n+```\n+\n+Another way to create a list is to use the `list()` constructor. The `list()` constructor is used to convert an iterable into a list like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = 'Jessica'\n+list(developer) # ['J', 'e', 's', 's', 'i', 'c', 'a']\n+```\n+\n+An iterable is a special type of object that can be looped over one item at a time. You will learn more about loops in Python later on.\n+\n+To get the total number of elements in a list, you can use the `len()` function like this:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+len(numbers) # 5\n+```\n+\n+If you wanted to update a value at a particular index, you can do something like this:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+programming_languages[0] = 'JavaScript'\n+print(programming_languages) # ['JavaScript', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+```\n+\n+Since lists are mutable, you can update any element in the list as long as you pass in a valid index number. If you pass in an index (either positive or negative) that is out of bounds for the list, then you will receive an `IndexError`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+programming_languages[10] = 'JavaScript'\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\n+IndexError: list assignment index out of range\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+If you want to remove an element from a list you can use the `del` keyword like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Jane Doe', 23, 'Python Developer']\n+del developer[1]\n+print(developer) # ['Jane Doe', 'Python Developer']\n+```\n+\n+Sometimes it is helpful to check if an element is inside the list. To do that, you can use the `in` keyword like this:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']\n+\n+'Rust' in programming_languages # True\n+'JavaScript' in programming_languages # False\n+```\n+\n+Sometimes it is common to have lists nested inside of other lists like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we have one nested list containing three popular programming languages. To access the nested list, you will need to access it using index `2` since lists are zero based indexed:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]\n+developer[2] # ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']\n+```\n+\n+Then to access the second language from that nested list, you will need to access it using index `1` like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]\n+developer[2][1] # 'Rust'\n+```\n+\n+Another common technique used with lists is unpacking values.\n+\n+Unpacking values from a list is a technique used to assign values from a list to new variables. Here is an example of unpacking a `developer` list into new variables called `name`, `age` and `job`. \n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer']\n+name, age, job = developer\n+\n+print(name) # 'Alice'\n+print(age) # 34\n+print(job) # 'Rust Developer'\n+```\n+\n+Here, `name` has the value `'Alice'`, `age` has the value `34`, and `job` has the value `'Rust Developer'`.\n+\n+If you need to collect any remaining elements from a list, you can use the asterisk (`*`) operator like this:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer']\n+name, *rest = developer\n+\n+print(name) # 'Alice'\n+print(rest) # [34, 'Rust Developer']\n+```\n+\n+In this example, `name` will still have the value `'Alice'`, and `rest` is a list of two items: the number `34` and the string `'Rust Developer'`.\n+\n+If the numbers of variables on the left side of the assignment operator doesn't match the total numbers of items in the list, then you will receive a `ValueError`:\n+\n+```py\n+developer = ['Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer']\n+name, age, job, city = developer\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\n+ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+The last concept we will look at is the slice operator (`:`). Similar to strings, you can access portions of a list by using the slice operator like this:\n+\n+```py\n+desserts = ['Cake', 'Cookies', 'Ice Cream', 'Pie', 'Brownies']\n+desserts[1:4] # ['Cookies', 'Ice Cream', 'Pie']\n+```\n+\n+In this example, the start index is `1` since that points to the second item in the list. Then we use the slice operator followed by an end index of `4`, which includes everything up to (but not including), the item at that index.\n+\n+Another thing you can do with the slice operator `:` is specify a step interval which determines how much to increment between the indices. Let's say you had a list of numbers like this:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n+```\n+\n+If you wanted to extract a list of just even numbers, you can use the slicing operator like this:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n+numbers[1::2] # [2, 4, 6]\n+```\n+\n+The first even number is at index `1`, so that will be the start index. Since we want to go through the end of the list, then we omit the end index. Lastly, we specify `2` for the optional step interval so it will only increment by `2` instead of the default `1`.\n+\n+Lists are a useful and flexible data structure that you will use a lot in your Python programs. In the next lecture, you will learn about common methods that you can use with lists.\n \n # --questions--\n \n@@ -22,7 +183,7 @@ They are two-based indexed.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Refer to the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Refer to the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n@@ -34,15 +195,15 @@ They are only used inside of classes.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Refer to the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Refer to the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n They are rarely used in Python programs.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Refer to the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Refer to the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n@@ -66,23 +227,23 @@ cities = ['Los Angeles', 'London', 'Tokyo']\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Refer to the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Refer to the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n `cities[0]`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Refer to the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Refer to the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n `cities[-1]`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Refer to the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Refer to the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

In this lecture, you will continue to learn about lists and some common methods associated with them like `append()`, `pop()`, and `sort()`.\n+\n+The first method we will look at is the `append()` method. This is used to add an item to the end of the list. Here is an example of using the `append()` method to add the number `6` to list of numbers:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+numbers.append(6)\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n+```\n+\n+If you want to add one list at the end of another, you can also use the `append()` method like this:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+even_numbers = [6, 8, 10]\n+\n+numbers.append(even_numbers)\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [6, 8, 10]]\n+```\n+\n+Notice how the entire `even_numbers` list is nested inside of the `numbers` list.\n+\n+But if you want to add all of the individual numbers from the `even_numbers` list at the end of the `numbers` list, then you can use the `extend()` method.\n+\n+The `extend()` method is similar to the `append()` method, but with `extend()` you can add multiple elements from one list to another. Here's an example of adding the numbers `6`, `8`, and `10` from one list to the end of the `numbers` list:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+even_numbers = [6, 8, 10]\n+\n+numbers.extend(even_numbers)\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10]\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the nested list is gone and it's just a list of numbers.\n+\n+To insert an element at a specific index in a list, you can use the `insert()` method. This method accepts two arguments: the index where you wish to insert the new item and the item you want to insert.\n+\n+Here is an example of using the `insert()` method:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+numbers.insert(2, 2.5)\n+\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5]\n+```\n+\n+The following code will insert the number `2.5` at index `2` in the `numbers` list.\n+\n+If you want to remove an element from a list, you can use the `remove()` method. Here is an example of using the `remove()` method to remove a duplicate number from a `numbers` list:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]\n+numbers.remove(5)\n+\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+```\n+\n+It is important to note that this method will only remove the first occurrence of an item. Not all of them:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n+numbers.remove(5)\n+\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]\n+```\n+\n+To remove an element at a specific index in the list, you can use the `pop()` method like this:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+numbers.pop(1) # The number 2 is returned\n+```\n+\n+If you don't specify an element for the `pop` method, then the last element is removed.\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+numbers.pop() # The number 5 is returned\n+```\n+\n+If you need to empty the list, then you can use the `clear()` method like this:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+numbers.clear()\n+\n+print(numbers) # []\n+```\n+\n+The next method we will take a look at is the the `sort()` method. This method is used to sort the elements in place. Here is an example of sorting a random list of numbers in place:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]\n+numbers.sort()\n+\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 19, 35, 41, 67]\n+```\n+\n+In contrast to the `sort()` method, there is the `sorted()` function which works for any iterable and returns a new sorted list instead of modifying the original list. For example:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]\n+sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n+\n+print(numbers) # [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]\n+print(sorted_numbers) # [1, 2, 19, 35, 41, 67]\n+```\n+\n+As a reminder, an iterable is a special type of object that you can loop over, allowing you to access each item one at a time. You'll learn more about how loops work in Python in a future lecture.\n+\n+Both the `sort()` method and `sorted()` function accept optional `key` and `reverse` parameters. You will learn more about these optional parameters in a future lecture when you learn about tuples. You'll also learn more about other built-in functions like `sorted()` in future lectures.\n+\n+The next method we will take a look at is the the `reverse()` method. This method, will reverse a list of elements in place like this:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n+numbers.reverse()\n+\n+print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n+```\n+\n+The last method we will take a look at is the `index` method. This is used to find the first index where an element can be found in a list. Here is an example of using the `index` method to find the language `'Java'` in a `programming_languages` list:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']\n+programming_languages.index('Java') # 1\n+```\n+\n+If the element cannot be found, then Python throws a `ValueError`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']\n+programming_languages.index('JavaScript')\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n+ValueError: 'JavaScript' is not in list\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+There are a few more methods for Python lists, but this initial list of methods is a good place to start.\n \n # --questions--\n \n@@ -74,23 +215,23 @@ Which of the following methods will reverse a list of elements in place?\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the last part of the video for the answer.\n+Review the last part of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n `reversedList()`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the last part of the video for the answer.\n+Review the last part of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n `reversingList()`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the last part of the video for the answer.\n+Review the last part of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

In this lecture you will learn how to work with different types of loops in Python.\n+\n+The first loop we will go over is the `for` loop. Here is an example of using a `for` loop to iterate through a list and print each item to the console:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']\n+\n+for language in programming_languages:\n+    print(language)\n+```\n+\n+The result would be:\n+\n+```md\n+Rust\n+Java\n+Python\n+C++\n+```\n+\n+Notice that the `print(language)` is indented inside of the loop. Without that indentation, you would get an `IndentationError`:\n+\n+```python\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 4, in <module>\n+IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line 3\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+You can also use a `for` loop to iterate through other iterables like a string. Here is an example of using a `for` loop to loop through the string `code` and print out each character:\n+\n+```py\n+for char in 'code':\n+    print(char)\n+```\n+\n+The result would be:\n+\n+```md\n+c\n+o\n+d\n+e\n+```\n+\n+Just like in JavaScript, you can also nest `for` loops in Python. Here is an example of using a nested `for` loop:\n+\n+```py\n+categories = ['Fruit', 'Vegetable']\n+foods = ['Apple', 'Carrot', 'Banana']\n+\n+for category in categories:\n+    for food in foods:\n+        print(category, food)\n+```\n+\n+The outer loop will iterate through each `category` in the `categories` list. For each `category`, the inner loop will iterate through each `food` in the `foods` list. Here is the result that will be printed to the console:\n+\n+```md\n+Fruit Apple\n+Fruit Carrot\n+Fruit Banana\n+Vegetable Apple\n+Vegetable Carrot\n+Vegetable Banana\n+```\n+\n+Another type of loop you can use in Python is the `while` loop. This type of loop will repeat a block of code until the condition is `False`. Here is an example of using a `while` loop for a guessing game:\n+\n+```py\n+secret_number = 3\n+guess = 0\n+\n+while guess != secret_number:\n+    guess = int(input('Guess the number (1-5): '))\n+    if guess != secret_number:\n+        print('Wrong! Try again.')\n+\n+print('You got it!')\n+```\n+\n+In this example we have a `secret_number` variable with the value of `3` and an initial guess of `0`. Then we use the `input` function to get input from the user, then convert the input string into and integer with the `int()` function, and assign it to the `guess` variable. If the user guesses correctly by inputting `3`, the `while` loop is broken out of and the message `You got it!` is printed to the console. Otherwise, the message `Wrong! Try again.` is printed to the console, and the loop repeats, prompting the user to guess again.\n+\n+Here's an example result:\n+\n+```md\n+Guess the number (1-5): 2\n+Wrong! Try again.\n+Guess the number (1-5): 1\n+Wrong! Try again.\n+Guess the number (1-5): 3\n+You got it!\n+```\n+\n+Just like in JavaScript, Python supports the `break` and `continue` statements.\n+\n+The `break` statement is used to stop the execution of a loop. Here is an example of using the `break` statement for a list of `developer_names`:\n+\n+```py\n+developer_names = ['Jess', 'Naomi', 'Tom']\n+\n+for developer in developer_names:\n+    if developer == 'Naomi':\n+        break\n+    print(developer)\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we iterate through a list of `developer_names` and print each name to the console. If the name is equal to `Naomi`, then we break out of the loop. This results in only the name `Jess` being printed to the console.\n+\n+The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move onto the next iteration. Let's modify the example from earlier to use the `continue` statement instead of `break`:\n+\n+```py\n+developer_names = ['Jess', 'Naomi', 'Tom']\n+\n+for developer in developer_names:\n+    if developer == 'Naomi':\n+        continue\n+    print(developer)\n+```\n+\n+Now the result in the console will be different. The names `Jess` and `Tom` are printed because the `continue` statement skips the second iteration of the loop when `developer` is equal to `Naomi`, and does not print that name to the console.\n+\n+Both `for` and `while` loops can be combined with an `else` clause, which is executed only when the loop is not terminated by a `break` statement. Here is an example of using multiple `for` loops:\n+\n+```python\n+words = ['sky', 'apple', 'rhythm', 'fly', 'orange']\n+\n+for word in words:\n+    for letter in word:\n+        if letter.lower() in 'aeiou':\n+            print(f\"'{word}' contains the vowel '{letter}'\")\n+            break\n+    else:\n+        print(f\"'{word}' has no vowels\")\n+```\n+\n+In this example we have a list of random words, and a `for` loop is used to loop through each word. Inside the outer `for` loop, we have another `for` loop to loop through each letter of each word. If the lowercase version of the letter is a vowel, we print the word followed by what vowels it contains, then break out of the inner loop. If the word contains no values, then we print a message indicating that.\n+\n+Here is what the result looks like in the console:\n+\n+```md\n+'sky' has no vowels\n+'apple' contains the vowel 'a'\n+'rhythm' has no vowels\n+'fly' has no vowels\n+'orange' contains the vowel 'o'\n+```\n+\n+Loops are very common in Python, so it's important to get comfortable with them. In the next few lectures, you will learn how to work with the `enumerate()` and `range()` functions in loops.\n \n # --questions--\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What will the following code return?\n+What will the following code print to the console?\n \n ```py\n-programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n-programming_languages.count('Rust')\n+programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']\n+\n+for language in programming_languages:\n+    print(language)\n ```\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-`2`\n+```md\n+Rust\n+Java\n+Python\n+C++\n+```\n \n ---\n \n-`1`\n+```md\n+Rust\n+Python\n+C++\n+```\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n-`0`\n+```md\n+Rust\n+Java\n+```\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n-`3`\n+```md\n+Rust\n+Python\n+Java\n+C++\n+```\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n 1\n \n ## --text--\n \n-What will be the result for the following code?\n-\n-```py\n-programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n-programming_languages.index('JavaScript')\n-```\n+Which of the following loops is used to repeat a block of code until a condition is `False`?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-`IndexError`\n+`list`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about which type of error is appropriate to communicate that a value cannot be found.\n+Only one of these options is a real type of loop used in both Python and JavaScript.\n \n ---\n \n-`RangeError`\n+`while`\n \n-### --feedback--\n+---\n \n-Think about which type of error is appropriate to communicate that a value cannot be found.\n+`continue`\n \n----\n+### --feedback--\n \n-`ValueError`\n+Only one of these options is a real type of loop used in both Python and JavaScript.\n \n ---\n \n-SyntaxError\n+`break`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Think about which type of error is appropriate to communicate that a value cannot be found.\n+Only one of these options is a real type of loop used in both Python and JavaScript.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-3\n+2\n \n ## --text--\n \n-Which of the following functions is used to return a new list of sorted results from an iterable?\n+Which of the following is used to stop the execution of a loop?\n \n ## --answers--\n \n-`sorts()`\n+`stop`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the last part of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n-`sorting()`\n+`end`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the last part of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n-`sort()`\n+`break`\n \n-### --feedback--\n+---\n \n-Review the last part of the video for the answer.\n+`halt`\n \n----\n+### --feedback--\n \n-`sorted()`\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n-4\n+3"

The `enumerate()` function keeps track of the index for an iterable and returns an enumerate object.\n+\n+If we pass the `languages` list to the `enumerate()` function and convert its returned value into a list with the `list()` function, it looks like this:\n+\n+```python\n+languages = ['Spanish', 'English', 'Russian', 'Chinese']\n+\n+list(enumerate(languages))\n+# [(0, 'Spanish'), (1, 'English'), (2, 'Russian'), (3, 'Chinese')]\n+```\n+\n+Each entry in the enumerate object (now a list) is a tuple containing a count, followed by a value from the iterable passed to the `enumerate()` function.\n+\n+Now, let's refactor the example from earlier to use the `enumerate()` function:\n+\n+```python\n+languages = ['Spanish', 'English', 'Russian', 'Chinese']\n+\n+for index, language in enumerate(languages):\n+    print(f'Index {index} and language {language}')\n+```\n+\n+We unpack the count and value for each tuple in the enumerate object into variables named `index` and `language`, respectively.

If this argument is omitted, then the count will begin at `0`. Here is an example of using the optional `start` argument:\n+\n+```python\n+languages = ['Spanish', 'English', 'Russian', 'Chinese']\n+\n+for index, language in enumerate(languages, 1):\n+    print(f'Index {index} and language {language}')\n+```\n+\n+And here is what the result will look like in the console:\n+\n+```md\n+Index 1 and language Spanish\n+Index 2 and language English\n+Index 3 and language Russian\n+Index 4 and language Chinese\n+```\n+\n+So far we've only been iterating over one list.

Well, you can use the `zip()` function for that, which combines lists into pairs of elements and returns an iterator of tuples.\n+\n+If we pass a list of `developers` and `ids` to the `zip()` function and convert its returned value into a list with the `list()` function, here's what it looks like:\n+\n+```python\n+developers = ['Naomi', 'Dario', 'Jessica', 'Tom']\n+ids = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n+\n+list(zip(developers, ids))\n+# [('Naomi', 1), ('Dario', 2), ('Jessica', 3), ('Tom', 4)]\n+```\n+\n+And here's an example of using the `zip()` function with a `for` loop to iterate over `developers` and `ids`:\n+\n+```python\n+developers = ['Naomi', 'Dario', 'Jessica', 'Tom']\n+ids = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n+\n+for name, id in zip(developers, ids):\n+    print(f'Name: {name}')\n+    print(f'ID: {id}')\n+```\n+\n+In this example, `zip()` combines the two lists into pairs of elements and returns an iterator of tuples. The `for` loop then unpacks each tuple into `name` and `id`. Finally, for each print statement, we are printing each `name` and `id` from the `ids` and `developers` lists respectively. Here is what the result looks like in the console:\n+\n+```md\n+Name: Naomi\n+ID: 1\n+Name: Dario\n+ID: 2\n+Name: Jessica\n+ID: 3\n+Name: Tom\n+ID: 4\n+```\n+\n+The `enumerate()` and `zip()` functions are very powerful, and when combined with loops, can make your code much more concise.\n \n # --questions--\n \n@@ -22,15 +129,15 @@ It is used to print the memory addresses for each element in a list.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n It is used to create tuples and sets from lists and return an `enumerate` object.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n@@ -42,7 +149,7 @@ It is used to speed up the performance for your Python applications.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n@@ -58,15 +165,15 @@ Which of the following optional arguments in the `enumerate()` function specifie\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n `position`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n@@ -78,7 +185,7 @@ Review the end of the video for the answer.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n@@ -98,23 +205,23 @@ It is used to create zip files.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n It is used to break out of a nested loop.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n It is used to create an iterable that saves memory starting from a list.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

Inside the loop, there's a condition that checks if the current number has a remainder of `0` when divided by `2`. This is used to determine if the number is even. If the condition is `True`, then the current `num` is appended at the end of the `even_numbers` list. Finally, we print the `even_numbers` list to the console.\n+\n+While this code works, there is a more concise way to write this that uses list comprehension instead. List comprehension allows you to create a new list in a single line by combining a loop and condition directly within square brackets. This makes the code shorter and often easier to read.\n+\n+Here is the refactored example from earlier using square brackets:\n+\n+```py\n+even_numbers = [num for num in range(21) if num % 2 == 0]\n+print(even_numbers)\n+```\n+\n+In this refactored example, the `even_numbers` list is created using a single line of code. The list comprehension loops through numbers from `0` to `20`, and includes only those that are divisible by `2`. This approach is more compact and eliminates the need for a separate loop and conditional block.\n+\n+Let's take a look at another example so we can better understand how list comprehension works:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n+result = [(num, 'Even') if num % 2 == 0 else (num, 'Odd') for num in numbers]\n+print(result)\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we have a list of numbers and want to create a new list of tuples indicating which numbers are even or odd. In the first part of the list comprehension, we use an `if` statement to check if the number is evenly divisible by `2`. If so, then the result is a tuple of that number followed by the word `Even`. Otherwise, the result is a tuple with the number followed by the word `Odd`.\n+\n+Here is what the result looks like printed in the console:\n+\n+```py\n+[(1, 'Odd'), (2, 'Even'), (3, 'Odd'), (4, 'Even'), (5, 'Odd')]\n+```\n+\n+Another way to create a list starting from an existing iterable is the `filter()` function. Here is an example of creating a new list of just words longer than four characters:\n+\n+```py\n+words = ['tree', 'sky', 'mountain', 'river', 'cloud', 'sun']\n+\n+def is_long_word(word):\n+    return len(word) > 4\n+\n+long_words = list(filter(is_long_word, words))\n+print(long_words) # ['mountain', 'river', 'cloud']\n+```\n+\n+The `filter()` function is used to select elements from an iterable that meet a specific condition. The `filter()` function accepts a function and an iterable for its arguments. In this example, we are passing in an `is_long_word` function into the `filter()` function to check if the current word count is greater than `4`. All words that have a character count greater than `4` are added into a new list and assigned to the `long_words` variable.\n+\n+Aside from the `filter()` function, there are a few more functions that are helpful when working with lists. Another function to be aware of is the `map()` function, which takes an iterable and applies a function to each of its elements. Here is an example of using the `map()` function to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit:\n+\n+```py\n+celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]\n+\n+def to_fahrenheit(temp):\n+    return (temp * 9/5) + 32\n+\n+fahrenheit = list(map(to_fahrenheit, celsius))\n+print(fahrenheit) # [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]\n+```\n+\n+Just like the `filter()` function, `map()` accepts a function and an iterable for its arguments. The `to_fahrenheit` function takes a temperature and converts it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n+\n+The last function we will look at is the `sum()` function. This function is used to get the sum from an iterable like a list or tuple. Here is an example of using the `sum()` function:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n+total = sum(numbers)\n+print(total) # Result: 50\n+```\n+\n+You can also pass in an optional `start` argument which sets the initial value for the summation. Here is an updated example using the `start` argument as a positional argument:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n+total = sum(numbers, 10) # positional argument\n+print(total) # 60\n+```\n+\n+You can also choose to use the `start` argument as a keyword argument like this instead:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n+total = sum(numbers, start=10) # keyword argument\n+print(total) # 60\n+```\n+\n+Both versions will produce the same result, but the keyword argument is a little more explicit.\n+\n+List comprehension as well as other functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sum()` might seem a little confusing at first. But with enough practice and time, you will start to feel more comfortable using them in your Python programs.\n \n # --questions--\n \n@@ -24,7 +118,7 @@ Which of the following is the correct way to use list comprehension?\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n@@ -40,7 +134,7 @@ Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n@@ -50,7 +144,7 @@ Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the beginning of the video for the answer.\n+Review the beginning of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n \n@@ -112,23 +206,23 @@ print(total) # ?\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n `40`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ---\n \n `70`\n \n ### --feedback--\n \n-Review the end of the video for the answer.\n+Review the end of the lecture for the answer.\n \n ## --video-solution--\n "

In this lecture, you'll learn about some common methods you'll use when working with tuples.\n+\n+The first method we will cover is `count()`. This method is used to determine how many times an item appears in a tuple. Here is an example of checking how many times the string `Rust` appears in a tuple named `programming_languages`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.count('Rust') # 2\n+```\n+\n+Since `Rust` appears twice in the tuple, the `count()` method returns the number `2`. If the specified item in the `count()` function is not present at all in the tuple, then the return value is `0`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.count('JavaScript') # 0\n+```\n+\n+If no arguments are passed into the `count()` function, then Python raises a `TypeError`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.count()\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\n+TypeError: tuple.count() takes exactly one argument (0 given)\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+The next method we will look at is the `index()` method. This method is used to find the index where a particular item is present in a tuple. Here is an example of using the `index()` method to find the index for the string `Java`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.index('Java') # 1\n+```\n+\n+If the specified item cannot be found, then Python raises a `ValueError`:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')\n+programming_languages.index('JavaScript')\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+Traceback (most recent call last):\n+  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\n+ValueError: tuple.index(x): x not in tuple\n+\"\"\"\n+```\n+\n+Another thing you can do with the `index()` method is to pass in optional start and stop index arguments. Here is an example of passing in an optional start index:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')\n+programming_languages.index('Python', 3) # 5\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we are specifying where to start searching for the string `Python`. By passing in the number `3` as the second argument to the `index()` function, we are specifying to start searching at index `3`. Since `Python` appears twice in the tuple, the `index()` function will return index `5` instead of index `2` because of the use of the optional start index argument.\n+\n+You can also pass in an optional stop index. Here is a modified example of specifying a start and stop index:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python', 'JavaScript', 'Python')\n+programming_languages.index('Python', 2, 5) # 2\n+```\n+\n+Now the result is index `2` because we are starting the search at index `2`, and searching up to, but not including, index `5`.\n+\n+Another commonly used function used with tuples is the `sorted()` function. In a previous lecture you learned about the `sort()` method for lists. Well, the `sorted()` function can be used on any iterable including tuples.\n+\n+Here is an example of creating a new list of numbers using the `sorted()` function:\n+\n+```py\n+numbers = (13, 2, 78, 3, 45, 67, 18, 7)\n+sorted(numbers) # [2, 3, 7, 13, 18, 45, 67, 78]\n+```\n+\n+The `sorted()` function will always create a new list of the sorted values. This differs from the `sort()` method which sorts the elements of a list in place and does not return a new list.\n+\n+If you need to customize the sorting behavior for an iterable, you can use the optional `reverse` and `key` arguments. Here is an example of using `key` argument to sort items in a tuple by length:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')\n+sorted(programming_languages, key=len)\n+\n+# Result\n+# ['C++', 'Rust', 'Java', 'Rust', 'Python', 'Python']\n+```\n+\n+If you want to create a new list of values in reverse order, then you can use the `reverse` argument like this:\n+\n+```py\n+programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')\n+\n+print(sorted(programming_languages, reverse=True))\n+\n+# Result\n+# ['Rust', 'Rust', 'Python', 'Python', 'Java', 'C++']\n+```\n+\n+Tuples are a common data type in Python.
