When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.\n \n+In addition, to help prepare for job interviews, freeCodeCamp.org includes The Odin Project (freeCodeCamp Remix), Coding Interview Prep, Project Euler, and Rosetta Code.\n+\n+A free, professional free Foundational C# with Microsoft Certification is also available.\n+\n ### The Learning Platform\n \n This code is running live at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)."
