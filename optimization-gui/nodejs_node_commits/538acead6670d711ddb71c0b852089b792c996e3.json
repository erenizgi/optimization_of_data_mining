DecimalFormat still handles\n- * parsing directly. However, DecimalFormat uses attributes of this class\n- * for parsing when possible.\n- *\n- * The public API of this class closely mirrors the legacy API of the\n- * legacy DecimalFormat deviating only when the legacy API does not make\n- * sense. For example, although DecimalFormat has a\n- * getPadCharacterString() method, DecimalFormatImpl has a getPadCharacter()\n- * method because formatting uses only a single pad character for padding.\n- *\n- * Each legacy DecimalFormat instance heap allocates its own instance of\n- * this class. Most DecimalFormat methods that deal with formatting simply\n- * delegate to the DecimalFormat's DecimalFormatImpl method.\n- *\n- * Because DecimalFormat extends NumberFormat, Each instance of this class\n- * \"borrows\" a pointer to the NumberFormat part of its enclosing DecimalFormat\n- * instance. This way each DecimalFormatImpl instance can read or even modify\n- * the NumberFormat portion of its enclosing DecimalFormat instance.\n- *\n- * Directed acyclic graph (DAG):\n- *\n- * This class can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each\n- * vertex is an attribute, and each directed edge indicates that the value\n- * of the destination attribute is calculated from the value of the source\n- * attribute. Attributes with setter methods reside at the bottom of the\n- * DAG. That is, no edges point to them. We call these independent attributes\n- * because their values can be set independently of one another. The rest of\n- * the attributes are derived attributes because their values depend on the\n- * independent attributes. DecimalFormatImpl often uses the derived\n- * attributes, not the independent attributes, when formatting numbers.\n- *\n- * The independent attributes at the bottom of the DAG correspond to the legacy\n- * attributes of DecimalFormat while the attributes at the top of the DAG\n- * correspond to the attributes of the new code. The edges of the DAG\n- * correspond to the code that handles the complex interaction among all the\n- * legacy attributes of the DecimalFormat API.\n- *\n- * We use a DAG for three reasons.\n- *\n- * First, the DAG preserves backward compatibility. Clients of the legacy\n- * DecimalFormat expect existing getters and setters of each attribute to be\n- * consistent. That means if a client sets a particular attribute to a new\n- * value, the attribute should retain that value until the client sets it to\n- * a new value. The DAG allows these attributes to remain consistent even\n- * though the new code may not use them when formatting.\n- *\n- * Second, the DAG obviates the need to recalculate derived attributes with\n- * each format. Instead, the DAG \"remembers\" the values of all derived\n- * attributes. Only setting an independent attribute requires a recalculation.\n- * Moreover, setting an independent attribute recalculates only the affected\n- * dependent attributes rather than all dependent attributes.\n- *\n- * Third, the DAG abstracts away the complex interaction among the legacy\n- * attributes of the DecimalFormat API.\n- *\n- * Only the independent attributes of the DAG have setters and getters.\n- * Derived attributes have no setters (and often no getters either).\n- *\n- * Copy and assign:\n- *\n- * For copy and assign, DecimalFormatImpl copies and assigns every attribute\n- * regardless of whether or not it is independent. We do this for simplicity.\n- *\n- * Implementation of the DAG:\n- *\n- * The DAG consists of three smaller DAGs:\n- * 1. Grouping attributes\n- * 2. Precision attributes\n- * 3. Formatting attributes.\n- *\n- * The first two DAGs are simple in that setting any independent attribute\n- * in the DAG recalculates all the dependent attributes in that DAG.\n- * The updateGrouping() and updatePrecision() perform the respective\n- * recalculations.\n- *\n- * Because some of the derived formatting attributes are expensive to\n- * calculate, the formatting attributes DAG is more complex. The\n- * updateFormatting() method is composed of many updateFormattingXXX()\n- * methods, each of which recalculates a single derived attribute. The\n- * updateFormatting() method accepts a bitfield of recently changed\n- * attributes and passes this bitfield by reference to each of the\n- * updateFormattingXXX() methods. Each updateFormattingXXX() method checks\n- * the bitfield to see if any of the attributes it uses to compute the XXX\n- * attribute changed. If none of them changed, it exists immediately. However,\n- * if at least one of them changed, it recalculates the XXX attribute and\n- * sets the corresponding bit in the bitfield. In this way, each\n- * updateFormattingXXX() method encodes the directed edges in the formatting\n- * DAG that point to the attribute its calculating.\n- *\n- * Maintenance of the updateFormatting() method.\n- *\n- * Use care when changing the updateFormatting() method.\n- * The updateFormatting() method must call each updateFormattingXXX() in the\n- * same partial order that the formatting DAG prescribes. That is, the\n- * attributes near the bottom of the DAG must be calculated before attributes\n- * further up. As we mentioned in the prvious paragraph, the directed edges of\n- * the formatting DAG are encoded within each updateFormattingXXX() method.\n- * Finally, adding new attributes may involve adding to the bitmap that the\n- * updateFormatting() method uses. The top most attributes in the DAG,\n- * those that do not point to any attributes but only have attributes\n- * pointing to it, need not have a slot in the bitmap.\n- *\n- * Keep in mind that most of the code that makes the legacy DecimalFormat API\n- * work the way it always has before can be found in these various updateXXX()\n- * methods. For example the updatePrecisionForScientific() method\n- * handles the complex interactions amoung the various precision attributes\n- * when formatting in scientific notation. Changing the way attributes\n- * interract, often means changing one of these updateXXX() methods.\n- *\n- * Conclusion:\n- *\n- * The DecimFmtImpl class is the glue code between the legacy and new\n- * number formatting code. It uses a direct acyclic graph (DAG) to\n- * maintain backward compatibility, to make the code efficient, and to\n- * abstract away the complex interraction among legacy attributs.\n- */\n-\n-\n-class DecimalFormatImpl : public UObject {\n-public:\n-\n-DecimalFormatImpl(\n-        NumberFormat *super,\n-        const Locale &locale,\n-        const UnicodeString &pattern,\n-        UErrorCode &status);\n-DecimalFormatImpl(\n-        NumberFormat *super,\n-        const UnicodeString &pattern,\n-        DecimalFormatSymbols *symbolsToAdopt,\n-        UParseError &parseError,\n-        UErrorCode &status);\n-DecimalFormatImpl(\n-        NumberFormat *super,\n-        const DecimalFormatImpl &other,\n-        UErrorCode &status);\n-DecimalFormatImpl &assign(\n-        const DecimalFormatImpl &other, UErrorCode &status);\n-virtual ~DecimalFormatImpl();\n-void adoptDecimalFormatSymbols(DecimalFormatSymbols *symbolsToAdopt);\n-const DecimalFormatSymbols &getDecimalFormatSymbols() const {\n-    return *fSymbols;\n-}\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        int32_t number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPosition &pos,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        int32_t number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPositionIterator *posIter,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        int64_t number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPosition &pos,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        double number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPosition &pos,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        const DigitList &number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPosition &pos,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        int64_t number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPositionIterator *posIter,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        double number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPositionIterator *posIter,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        const DigitList &number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPositionIterator *posIter,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        StringPiece number,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPositionIterator *posIter,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        const VisibleDigitsWithExponent &digits,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPosition &pos,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-UnicodeString &format(\n-        const VisibleDigitsWithExponent &digits,\n-        UnicodeString &appendTo,\n-        FieldPositionIterator *posIter,\n-        UErrorCode &status) const;\n-\n-UBool operator==(const DecimalFormatImpl &) const;\n-\n-UBool operator!=(const DecimalFormatImpl &other) const {\n-    return !(*this == other);\n-}\n-\n-void setRoundingMode(DecimalFormat::ERoundingMode mode) {\n-    fRoundingMode = mode;\n-    fEffPrecision.fMantissa.fExactOnly = (fRoundingMode == DecimalFormat::kRoundUnnecessary);\n-    fEffPrecision.fMantissa.fRoundingMode = mode;\n-}\n-DecimalFormat::ERoundingMode getRoundingMode() const {\n-    return fRoundingMode;\n-}\n-void setFailIfMoreThanMaxDigits(UBool b) {\n-    fEffPrecision.fMantissa.fFailIfOverMax = b;\n-}\n-UBool isFailIfMoreThanMaxDigits() const { return fEffPrecision.fMantissa.fFailIfOverMax;

Private to DecimalFormat.  Handles the transcoding\n- * between numeric values and strings of characters.  Only handles\n- * non-negative numbers.  The division of labor between DigitList and\n- * DecimalFormat is that DigitList handles the radix 10 representation\n- * issues; DecimalFormat handles the locale-specific issues such as\n- * positive/negative, grouping, decimal point, currency, and so on.\n- * <P>\n- * A DigitList is really a representation of a floating point value.\n- * It may be an integer value; we assume that a double has sufficient\n- * precision to represent all digits of a long.\n- * <P>\n- * The DigitList representation consists of a string of characters,\n- * which are the digits radix 10, from '0' to '9'.  It also has a radix\n- * 10 exponent associated with it.  The value represented by a DigitList\n- * object can be computed by mulitplying the fraction f, where 0 <= f < 1,\n- * derived by placing all the digits of the list to the right of the\n- * decimal point, by 10^exponent.\n- *\n- * --------\n- *\n- * DigitList vs. decimalNumber:\n- *\n- *    DigitList stores digits with the most significant first.\n- *    decNumber stores digits with the least significant first.\n- *\n- *    DigitList, decimal point is before the most significant.\n- *    decNumber, decimal point is after the least signficant digit.\n- *\n- *       digitList:    0.ddddd * 10 ^ exp\n- *       decNumber:    ddddd. * 10 ^ exp\n- *\n- *       digitList exponent = decNumber exponent + digit count\n- *\n- *    digitList, digits are platform invariant chars, '0' - '9'\n- *    decNumber, digits are binary, one per byte, 0 - 9.\n- *\n- *       (decNumber library is configurable in how digits are stored, ICU has configured\n- *        it this way for convenience in replacing the old DigitList implementation.)\n- */\n-class U_I18N_API DigitList : public UMemory { // Declare external to make compiler happy\n-public:\n-\n-    DigitList();\n-    ~DigitList();\n-\n-    /* copy constructor\n-     * @param DigitList The object to be copied.\n-     * @return the newly created object.\n-     */\n-    DigitList(const DigitList&);
