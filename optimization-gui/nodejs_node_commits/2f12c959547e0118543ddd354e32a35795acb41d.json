    "message": "doc: edit text about revoking deprecations\n\n* \"un-deprecation\" ಠ_ಠ -> \"revoking deprecations\"\n* \"From time-to-time\" -> \"Occastionally\"\n* \"semver-major\" and \"semver-minor\" are jargon that readers who don't\n  follow our issue tracker will not know. Remove the sentence as it\n  doesn't really impact end users. The deprecation is revoked when it is\n  revoked. Rules around the releases where deprecations can be revoked\n  may be added to the COLLABORATOR_GUIDE in the extensive section about\n  deprecations there. If so, great, but let's still remove it here as\n  having the information scattered in two places makes it likely that\n  one will be edited to contradict the other and then it won't be clear\n  which one is correct.\n* Remove unneeded italics. The italicized sentence is not hugely\n  critical information that we desperately want users to know. Most\n  users won't care. They will only care about the deprecation message\n  that they are looking up at that moment.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20519\nReviewed-By: Vse Mozhet Byt <vsemozhetbyt@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Refael Ackermann <refack@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ruben Bridgewater <ruben@bridgewater.de>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>",
