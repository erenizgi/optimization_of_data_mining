Remove the bullet point about TSC having authority to\ndetermine that a breaking change is necessary on LTS and Current release\nbranches. Retaining that authority would require de-chartering the\nRelease WG.\n\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/660\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25780\nReviewed-By: Sakthipriyan Vairamani <thechargingvolcano@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Michaël Zasso <targos@protonmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Richard Lau <riclau@uk.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Myles Borins <myles.borins@gmail.com>",
