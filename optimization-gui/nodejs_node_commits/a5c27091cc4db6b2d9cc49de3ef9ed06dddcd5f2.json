In the\n worker, it does it by disconnecting the channel, and then exiting with code `0`.\n \n+Because `kill()` attempts to gracefully disconnect the worker process, it is\n+susceptible to waiting indefinitely for the disconnect to complete. For example,\n+if the worker enters an infinite loop, a graceful disconnect will never occur.\n+If the graceful disconnect behavior is not needed, use `worker.process.kill()`.\n+\n Causes `.exitedAfterDisconnect` to be set.\n \n This method is aliased as `worker.destroy()` for backwards compatibility."
