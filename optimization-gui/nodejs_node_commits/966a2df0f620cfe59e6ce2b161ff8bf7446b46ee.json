The exceptions to this rule are:\n \n-Exceptions to this rule may be made in the following cases:\n-\n-* Adding or removing errors thrown or reported by a Public API;\n+* Adding or removing errors thrown or reported by a public API;\n * Changing error messages for errors without error code;\n-* Altering the timing and non-internal side effects of the Public API.\n-\n-Such changes *must* be handled as semver-major changes but MAY be landed\n-without a [Deprecation cycle](#deprecation-cycle).\n-\n-Note that errors thrown, along with behaviors and APIs implemented by\n-dependencies of Node.js (e.g. those originating from V8) are generally not\n-under the control of Node.js and therefore *are not directly subject to this\n-policy*. However, care should still be taken when landing updates to\n-dependencies when it is known or expected that breaking changes to error\n-handling may have been made. Additional CI testing may be required.\n-\n-From time-to-time, in particularly exceptional cases, the TSC may be asked to\n-consider and approve additional exceptions to this rule.\n+* Altering the timing and non-internal side effects of the public API;\n+* Changes to errors thrown by dependencies of Node.js, such as V8;\n+* One-time exceptions granted by the TSC.\n \n For more information, see [Deprecations](#deprecations).\n "
