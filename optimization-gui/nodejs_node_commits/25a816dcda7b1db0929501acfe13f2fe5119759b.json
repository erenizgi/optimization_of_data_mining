While last release was focused largely around PRs from the\n+CLI team, this release is mostly pulling in community PRs in npm itself and its\n+dependencies! We've got a good chunk of wonderful contributions for y'all, and\n+even new features and performance improvements! 🎉\n+\n+We're hoping to continue our biweekly (as in every-other-week biweekly) release\n+schedule from now on, so you should be seeing more steady npm releases from here\n+on out. And that's good, 'cause we've got a _ton_ of new stuff on our roadmap\n+for this year.

This gives a\n+  cross-application, consistent way of disabling ANSI color code output. Note\n+  that npm already supported this through `--no-color` or\n+  `npm_config_color='false'` configurations, so this is just another way to do\n+  it.\n+  ([@chneukirchen](https://github.com/chneukirchen))\n+* [`fc8761daf`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/fc8761daf1e8749481457973890fa516eb96a195)\n+  [#19629](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19629)\n+  Give more detailed, contextual information when npm fails to parse\n+  `package-lock.json` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, instead of saying `JSON parse\n+  error` and leaving you out in the cold.\n+  ([@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg))\n+* [`1d368e1e6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1d368e1e63229f236b9dbabf628989fa3aa98bdb)\n+  [#19157](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19157)\n+  Add `--no-proxy` config option.

Since this is the first\n+release since that went out, we've had a few fixes and improvements now that\n+folks have actually gotten their hands on it! Benchmarks have been super\n+promising so far, and I've gotten messages from a lot of you saying you've sped\n+up your CI work by **2-5x** in some cases! Have a good example? Tell us on\n+Twitter!\n+\n+`npm ci` is, right now, [the fastest\n+installer](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable)\n+you can use in CI situations, so go check it out if you haven't already! We'll\n+continue doing performance improvements on it, and a lot of those will help make\n+`npm install` fast as well. 🏎😎\n+\n+* [`0d7f203d9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/0d7f203d9e86cc6c8d69107689ea60fc7cbab424)\n+  `libcipm@1.6.0`\n+  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))\n+\n+This `libcipm` release includes a number of improvements:\n+\n+* **PERFORMANCE** Reduce calls to `read-package-json` and separate JSON update phase from man/bin linking phase. `npm ci` should be noticeably faster.\n+* **FEATURE** Progress bar now fills up as packages are installed, instead of sitting there doing nothing.\n+* **BUGFIX** Add support for `--only` and `--also` options.\n+* **BUFGIX** Linking binaries and running scripts in parallel was causing packages to sometimes clobber each other when hoisted, as well as potentially running too many run-scripts in parallel. This is now a serial operation, and it turns out to have had relatively little actual performance impact.\n+* **BUGFIX** Stop adding `_from` to directory deps (aka `file:packages/my-dep`).\n+\n+### BUGFIXES\n+\n+* [`58d2aa58d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/58d2aa58d5f9c4db49f57a5f33952b3106778669)\n+  [#20027](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20027)\n+  Use a specific mtime when packing tarballs instead of the beginning of epoch\n+  time. This should allow `npm pack` to generate tarballs with identical hashes\n+  for identical contents, while fixing issues with some `zip` implementations\n+  that do not support pre-1980 timestamps.\n+  ([@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs))\n+* [`4f319de1d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/4f319de1d6e8aca5fb68f78023425233da4f07f6)\n+  Don't fall back to couch adduser if we didn't try couch login.\n+  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))\n+* [`c8230c9bb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c8230c9bbd596156a4a8cfe62f2370f81d22bd9f)\n+  [#19608](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19608)\n+  Fix issue where using the npm-bundled `npx` on Windows was invoking `npx\n+  prefix` (and downloading that package).\n+  ([@laggingreflex](https://github.com/laggingreflex))\n+* [`d70c01970`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d70c01970311f4e84b35eef8559c114136a9ebc7)\n+  [#18953](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/18953)\n+  Avoid using code that depends on `node@>=4` in the `unsupported` check, so npm\n+  can report the issue normally instead of syntax-crashing.\n+  ([@deployable](https://github.com/deployable))\n+\n+### DOCUMENTATION\n+\n+* [`4477ca2d9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/4477ca2d993088ac40ef5cf39d1f9c68be3d6252)\n+  `marked@0.3.17`: Fixes issue preventing correct rendering of backticked\n+  strings. man pages should be rendering correctly now instead of having empty\n+  spaces wherever backticks were used.\n+  ([@joshbruce](https://github.com/joshbruce))\n+* [`71076ebda`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/71076ebdaddd04f2bf330fe668f15750bcff00ea)\n+  [#19950](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19950)\n+  Add a note to install --production.\n+  ([@kyranet](https://github.com/kyranet))\n+* [`3a33400b8`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3a33400b89a8dd00fa9a49fcb57a8add36f79fa6)\n+  [#19957](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19957)\n+  nudge around some details in ci docs\n+  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))\n+* [`06038246a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/06038246a3fa58d6f42bb4ab897aa534ff6ed282)\n+  [#19893](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19893)\n+  Add a common open reason to the issue template.\n+  ([@MrStonedOne](https://github.com/MrStonedOne))\n+* [`7376dd8af`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7376dd8afb654929adade126b4925461aa52da12)\n+  [#19870](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19870)\n+  Fix typo in `npm-config.md`\n+  ([@joebowbeer](https://github.com/joebowbeer))\n+* [`5390ed4fa`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/5390ed4fa2b480f7c58fff6ee670120149ec2d45)\n+  [#19858](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19858)\n+  Fix documented default value for config save option.

If your\n+`package.json` and your lock-file are out of sync then it will report an error.\n+\n+It works by throwing away your `node_modules` and recreating it from scratch.\n+\n+Beyond guaranteeing you that you'll only get what is in your lock-file it's\n+also much faster (2x-10x!) than `npm install` when you don't start with a\n+`node_modules`.\n+\n+As you may take from the name, we expect it to be a big boon to continuous\n+integration environments.

It can be significantly faster than a regular npm install by\n+skipping certain user-oriented features. It is also more strict than a regular\n+install, which can help catch errors or inconsistencies caused by the\n+incrementally-installed local environments of most npm users.\n+\n+In short, the main differences between using `npm install` and `npm ci` are:\n+\n+* The project **must** have an existing `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.\n+* If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in `package.json`, `npm ci` will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock.\n+* `npm ci` can only install entire projects at a time: individual dependencies cannot be added with this command.\n+* If a `node_modules` is already present, it will be automatically removed before `npm ci` begins its install.\n+* It will never write to `package.json` or any of the package-locks: installs are essentially frozen.\n+\n+## SEE ALSO\n+\n+* npm-install(1)\n+* npm-package-locks(5)"

To continue using a Streams2 version use `npm install through2@0` to fetch the latest version of 0.x.x. More information about Streams2 vs Streams3 and recommendations see the article **[Why I don't use Node's core 'stream' module](http://r.va.gg/2014/06/why-i-dont-use-nodes-core-stream-module.html)**.\n+\n+```js\n+fs.createReadStream('ex.txt')\n+  .pipe(through2(function (chunk, enc, callback) {\n+    for (var i = 0; i < chunk.length; i++)\n+      if (chunk[i] == 97)\n+        chunk[i] = 122 // swap 'a' for 'z'\n+\n+    this.push(chunk)\n+\n+    callback()\n+   }))\n+  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('out.txt'))\n+  .on('finish', function () {\n+    doSomethingSpecial()\n+  })\n+```\n+\n+Or object streams:\n+\n+```js\n+var all = []\n+\n+fs.createReadStream('data.csv')\n+  .pipe(csv2())\n+  .pipe(through2.obj(function (chunk, enc, callback) {\n+    var data = {\n+        name    : chunk[0]\n+      , address : chunk[3]\n+      , phone   : chunk[10]\n+    }\n+    this.push(data)\n+\n+    callback()\n+  }))\n+  .on('data', function (data) {\n+    all.push(data)\n+  })\n+  .on('end', function () {\n+    doSomethingSpecial(all)\n+  })\n+```\n+\n+Note that `through2.obj(fn)` is a convenience wrapper around `through2({ objectMode: true }, fn)`.\n+\n+## API\n+\n+<b><code>through2([ options, ] [ transformFunction ] [, flushFunction ])</code></b>\n+\n+Consult the **[stream.Transform](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform)** documentation for the exact rules of the `transformFunction` (i.e. `this._transform`) and the optional `flushFunction` (i.e. `this._flush`).\n+\n+### options\n+\n+The options argument is optional and is passed straight through to `stream.Transform`. So you can use `objectMode:true` if you are processing non-binary streams (or just use `through2.obj()`).\n+\n+The `options` argument is first, unlike standard convention, because if I'm passing in an anonymous function then I'd prefer for the options argument to not get lost at the end of the call:\n+\n+```js\n+fs.createReadStream('/tmp/important.dat')\n+  .pipe(through2({ objectMode: true, allowHalfOpen: false },\n+    function (chunk, enc, cb) {\n+      cb(null, 'wut?') // note we can use the second argument on the callback\n+                       // to provide data as an alternative to this.push('wut?')\n+    }\n+  )\n+  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/wut.txt'))\n+```\n+\n+### transformFunction\n+\n+The `transformFunction` must have the following signature: `function (chunk, encoding, callback) {}`. A minimal implementation should call the `callback` function to indicate that the transformation is done, even if that transformation means discarding the chunk.\n+\n+To queue a new chunk, call `this.push(chunk)`&mdash;this can be called as many times as required before the `callback()` if you have multiple pieces to send on.\n+\n+Alternatively, you may use `callback(err, chunk)` as shorthand for emitting a single chunk or an error.\n+\n+If you **do not provide a `transformFunction`** then you will get a simple pass-through stream.\n+\n+### flushFunction\n+\n+The optional `flushFunction` is provided as the last argument (2nd or 3rd, depending on whether you've supplied options) is called just prior to the stream ending. Can be used to finish up any processing that may be in progress.\n+\n+```js\n+fs.createReadStream('/tmp/important.dat')\n+  .pipe(through2(\n+    function (chunk, enc, cb) { cb(null, chunk) }, // transform is a noop\n+    function (cb) { // flush function\n+      this.push('tacking on an extra buffer to the end');\n+      cb();\n+    }\n+  ))\n+  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/wut.txt'));\n+```\n+\n+<b><code>through2.ctor([ options, ] transformFunction[, flushFunction ])</code></b>\n+\n+Instead of returning a `stream.Transform` instance, `through2.ctor()` returns a **constructor** for a custom Transform. This is useful when you want to use the same transform logic in multiple instances.\n+\n+```js\n+var FToC = through2.ctor({objectMode: true}, function (record, encoding, callback) {\n+  if (record.temp != null && record.unit == \"F\") {\n+    record.temp = ( ( record.temp - 32 ) * 5 ) / 9\n+    record.unit = \"C\"\n+  }\n+  this.push(record)\n+  callback()\n+})\n+\n+// Create instances of FToC like so:\n+var converter = new FToC()\n+// Or:\n+var converter = FToC()\n+// Or specify/override options when you instantiate, if you prefer:\n+var converter = FToC({objectMode: true})\n+```\n+\n+## See Also\n+\n+  - [through2-map](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-map) - Array.prototype.map analog for streams.\n+  - [through2-filter](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-filter) - Array.prototype.filter analog for streams.\n+  - [through2-reduce](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-reduce) - Array.prototype.reduce analog for streams.\n+  - [through2-spy](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-spy) - Wrapper for simple stream.PassThrough spies.\n+  - the [mississippi stream utility collection](https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi) includes `through2` as well as many more useful stream modules similar to this one\n+\n+## License\n+\n+**through2** is Copyright (c) 2013 Rod Vagg [@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg) and licensed under the MIT license.
