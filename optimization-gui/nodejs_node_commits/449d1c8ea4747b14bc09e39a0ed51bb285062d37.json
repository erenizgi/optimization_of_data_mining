Changed \"executes in parallel\" to \"can\nexecute in parallel\" for the documentation of napi_create_async_work\nexecute parameter.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19073\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19071\nReviewed-By: Michael Dawson <michael_dawson@ca.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ruben Bridgewater <ruben@bridgewater.de>",
