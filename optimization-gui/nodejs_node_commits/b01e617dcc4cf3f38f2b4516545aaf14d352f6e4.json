    "message": "doc: require two approvals to land changes\n\nCurrently, changes require approval by one Collaborator in most cases.\nHowever there are situations where two approvals are required. For\nexample, breaking changes require two approvals from TSC members. And\nfast-tracking a request requires two approvals.\n\nAdditionally, although only one approval is strictly required, in\npractice, we nearly always seek a second approval when there is only\none.\n\nLastly, concerns have been raised about (perhaps unintentionally) gaming\nthe one-approval system by suggesting a change to someone else, and then\napproving that change when the user submits a pull request. This\nresolves (or at least mitigates) that concern.\n\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19564\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22255\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19564\nReviewed-By: Anna Henningsen <anna@addaleax.net>\nReviewed-By: Сковорода Никита Андреевич <chalkerx@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Matheus Marchini <mat@mmarchini.me>\nReviewed-By: Bryan English <bryan@bryanenglish.com>\nReviewed-By: Matteo Collina <matteo.collina@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Refael Ackermann <refack@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: John-David Dalton <john.david.dalton@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ruben Bridgewater <ruben@bridgewater.de>\nReviewed-By: Jon Moss <me@jonathanmoss.me>\nReviewed-By: Benjamin Gruenbaum <benjamingr@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ujjwal Sharma <usharma1998@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Roman Reiss <me@silverwind.io>\nReviewed-By: George Adams <george.adams@uk.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Anatoli Papirovski <apapirovski@mac.com>\nReviewed-By: Tobias Nießen <tniessen@tnie.de>\nReviewed-By: Michaël Zasso <targos@protonmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Myles Borins <myles.borins@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Sakthipriyan Vairamani <thechargingvolcano@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Joyee Cheung <joyeec9h3@gmail.com>",
