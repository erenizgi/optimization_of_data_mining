    "message": "doc: clarify ServerResponse explanations\n\nIn short: `ServerResponse` acutally inherits from `OutgoingMessage`,\nwith a series of methods like those in `Stream.Writable`. So we cannot\nuse `implements`(this has made poeple feel puzzled because there are\nstill many methods we don't need or have), so `inherits from Stream` is\nenough, due to some core reasons and performance told by mcollina from\nthe ref (See some latest discussions at Ref).\n\nRef: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/14146.\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22305\nReviewed-By: Matteo Collina <matteo.collina@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Vse Mozhet Byt <vsemozhetbyt@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Jon Moss <me@jonathanmoss.me>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>",
