It also fails consistently on my personal laptop.\nThese changes make it pass consistently with current master but fail\nconsistently with Node.js 10.11 (which was the last release in the 10.x\nline before the fix that the test is for). It succeeds/fails as expected\nwhether or not I am connected to the network.\n\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/25305\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25358\nReviewed-By: Anna Henningsen <anna@addaleax.net>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Gireesh Punathil <gpunathi@in.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Sakthipriyan Vairamani <thechargingvolcano@gmail.com>",
