    "message": "tools: remove obsolete entries from license\n\nThe LICENSE file has a few entries for things that no longer ship with\nthe code base. They are installed via npm instead. Remove them from the\nlicense file.\n\nRunning the license builder on a fresh checkout will\nresult in errors until this change lands, since the necessary\ninformation is not in the source tree until the `npm install` happens.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21979\nReviewed-By: Anna Henningsen <anna@addaleax.net>\nReviewed-By: Jon Moss <me@jonathanmoss.me>\nReviewed-By: Richard Lau <riclau@uk.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Yuta Hiroto <hello@hiroppy.me>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>",
