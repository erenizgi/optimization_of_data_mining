We’ll announce when all of the changes necessary to support JSCS users in ESLint are complete and will start encouraging JSCS users to switch to ESLint at that time.\n \n-## Releases\n+If you are having issues with JSCS, you can try to move to ESLint.

If you install ESLint globally, your plugins must also be installed globally; if you install ESLint locally, your plugins must also be installed locally.\n \n-Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you're reporting:\n+If you are trying to run globally, make sure your plugins are installed globally (use `npm ls -g`).\n \n-* [Bug Report](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/reporting-bugs)\n-* [Propose a New Rule](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/new-rules)\n-* [Proposing a Rule Change](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/rule-changes)\n-* [Request a Change](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/changes)\n+If you are trying to run locally:\n+\n+* Make sure your plugins (and ESLint) are both in your project's `package.json` as devDependencies (or dependencies, if your project uses ESLint at runtime).\n+* Make sure you have run `npm install` and all your dependencies are installed.\n+\n+In all cases, make sure your plugins' peerDependencies have been installed as well. You can use `npm view eslint-plugin-myplugin peerDepencies` to see what peer dependencies `eslint-plugin-myplugin` has.\n+\n+### Does ESLint support JSX?\n+\n+Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)). Please note that supporting JSX syntax *is not* the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn't recognize. We recommend using [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) if you are using React and want React semantics.\n+\n+### What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?\n+\n+ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5 (default), 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax (and other settings, like global variables or your target environments) through [configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring).\n+\n+### What about experimental features?\n+\n+ESLint's parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.\n+\n+In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use the [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) parser and [eslint-plugin-babel](https://github.com/babel/eslint-plugin-babel) to use any option available in Babel.\n+\n+Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our [contributing guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing). Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.\n+\n+### Where to ask for help?\n+\n+Join our [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/eslint) or [Chatroom](https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint).\n+\n+## Releases\n+\n+We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday.\n \n ## Semantic Versioning Policy\n \n@@ -184,62 +189,158 @@ According to our policy, any minor update may report more errors than the previo\n \n [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Feslint%2Feslint.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Feslint%2Feslint?ref=badge_large)\n \n-## Frequently Asked Questions\n-\n-### How is ESLint different from JSHint?\n-\n-The most significant difference is that ESLint has pluggable linting rules. That means you can use the rules it comes with, or you can extend it with rules created by others or by yourself!\n-\n-### How does ESLint performance compare to JSHint?\n-\n-ESLint is slower than JSHint, usually 2-3x slower on a single file. This is because ESLint uses Espree to construct an AST before it can evaluate your code whereas JSHint evaluates your code as it's being parsed. The speed is also based on the number of rules you enable; the more rules you enable, the slower the process.\n-\n-Despite being slower, we believe that ESLint is fast enough to replace JSHint without causing significant pain.\n-\n-### I heard ESLint is going to replace JSCS?\n-\n-Yes. Since we are solving the same problems, ESLint and JSCS teams have decided to join forces and work together in the development of ESLint instead of competing with each other. You can read more about this in both [ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2016/04/welcoming-jscs-to-eslint) and [JSCS](https://medium.com/@markelog/jscs-end-of-the-line-bc9bf0b3fdb2#.u76sx334n) announcements.\n-\n-### So, should I stop using JSCS and start using ESLint?\n-\n-Maybe, depending on how much you need it. [JSCS has reached end of life](https://eslint.org/blog/2016/07/jscs-end-of-life), but if it is working for you then there is no reason to move yet. We are still working to smooth the transition.

We’ll announce when all of the changes necessary to support JSCS users in ESLint are complete and will start encouraging JSCS users to switch to ESLint at that time.\n-\n-If you are having issues with JSCS, you can try to move to ESLint. We are focusing our time and energy on JSCS compatibility issues.\n-\n-### Is ESLint just linting or does it also check style?\n-\n-ESLint does both traditional linting (looking for problematic patterns) and style checking (enforcement of conventions). You can use it for both.\n-\n-### Why can't ESLint find my plugins?\n-\n-ESLint can be [globally or locally installed](#installation-and-usage).

For questions\n-and discussion, please use the\n-[Tern discussion forum](https://discuss.ternjs.net).\n-\n-## Installation\n-\n-The easiest way to install acorn is with [`npm`][npm].\n-\n-[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/\n-\n-```sh\n-npm install acorn\n-```\n-\n-Alternately, download the source.\n-\n-```sh\n-git clone https://github.com/ternjs/acorn.git\n-```\n-\n-## Components\n-\n-When run in a CommonJS (node.js) or AMD environment, exported values\n-appear in the interfaces exposed by the individual files, as usual.\n-When loaded in the browser (Acorn works in any JS-enabled browser more\n-recent than IE5) without any kind of module management, a single\n-global object `acorn` will be defined, and all the exported properties\n-will be added to that.\n-\n-### Main parser\n-\n-This is implemented in `dist/acorn.js`, and is what you get when you\n-`require(\"acorn\")` in node.js.\n-\n-**parse**`(input, options)` is used to parse a JavaScript program.\n-The `input` parameter is a string, `options` can be undefined or an\n-object setting some of the options listed below. The return value will\n-be an abstract syntax tree object as specified by the\n-[ESTree spec][estree].\n-\n-When  encountering   a  syntax   error,  the   parser  will   raise  a\n-`SyntaxError` object with a meaningful  message. The error object will\n-have a `pos` property that indicates the character offset at which the\n-error occurred,  and a `loc`  object that contains a  `{line, column}`\n-object referring to that same position.\n-\n-[estree]: https://github.com/estree/estree\n-\n-- **ecmaVersion**: Indicates the ECMAScript version to parse. Must be\n-  either 3, 5, 6, or 7. This influences support for strict mode, the set\n-  of reserved words, and support for new syntax features. Default is 6.\n-\n-  **NOTE**: Only 'stage 4' (finalized) ECMAScript 7 features are being\n-  implemented by Acorn. That means that most of the draft standard is\n-  not yet being parsed.\n-\n-- **sourceType**: Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be\n-  either `\"script\"` or `\"module\"`.\n-\n-- **onInsertedSemicolon**: If given a callback, that callback will be\n-  called whenever a missing semicolon is inserted by the parser. The\n-  callback will be given the character offset of the point where the\n-  semicolon is inserted as argument, and if `locations` is on, also a\n-  `{line, column}` object representing this position.\n-\n-- **onTrailingComma**: Like `onInsertedSemicolon`, but for trailing\n-  commas.\n-\n-- **allowReserved**: If `false`, using a reserved word will generate\n-  an error. Defaults to `true` for `ecmaVersion` 3, `false` for higher\n-  versions. When given the value `\"never\"`, reserved words and\n-  keywords can also not be used as property names (as in Internet\n-  Explorer's old parser).\n-\n-- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: By default, a return statement at\n-  the top level raises an error. Set this to `true` to accept such\n-  code.\n-\n-- **allowImportExportEverywhere**: By default, `import` and `export`\n-  declarations can only appear at a program's top level. Setting this\n-  option to `true` allows them anywhere where a statement is allowed.\n-\n-- **allowHashBang**: When this is enabled (off by default), if the\n-  code starts with the characters `#!` (as in a shellscript), the\n-  first line will be treated as a comment.\n-\n-- **locations**: When `true`, each node has a `loc` object attached\n-  with `start` and `end` subobjects, each of which contains the\n-  one-based line and zero-based column numbers in `{line, column}`\n-  form. Default is `false`.\n-\n-- **onToken**: If a function is passed for this option, each found\n-  token will be passed in same format as tokens returned from\n-  `tokenizer().getToken()`.\n-\n-  If array is passed, each found token is pushed to it.\n-\n-  Note that you are not allowed to call the parser from the\n-  callback—that will corrupt its internal state.\n-\n-- **onComment**: If a function is passed for this option, whenever a\n-  comment is encountered the function will be called with the\n-  following parameters:\n-\n-  - `block`: `true` if the comment is a block comment, false if it\n-    is a line comment.\n-  - `text`: The content of the comment.\n-  - `start`: Character offset of the start of the comment.\n-  - `end`: Character offset of the end of the comment.\n-\n-  When the `locations` options is on, the `{line, column}` locations\n-  of the comment’s start and end are passed as two additional\n-  parameters.\n-\n-  If array is passed for this option, each found comment is pushed\n-  to it as object in Esprima format:\n-\n-  ```javascript\n-  {\n-    \"type\": \"Line\" | \"Block\",\n-    \"value\": \"comment text\",\n-    \"start\": Number,\n-    \"end\": Number,\n-    // If `locations` option is on:\n-    \"loc\": {\n-      \"start\": {line: Number, column: Number}\n-      \"end\": {line: Number, column: Number}\n-    },\n-    // If `ranges` option is on:\n-    \"range\": [Number, Number]\n-  }\n-  ```\n-\n-  Note that you are not allowed to call the parser from the\n-  callback—that will corrupt its internal state.\n-\n-- **ranges**: Nodes have their start and end characters offsets\n-  recorded in `start` and `end` properties (directly on the node,\n-  rather than the `loc` object, which holds line/column data. To also\n-  add a [semi-standardized][range] `range` property holding a\n-  `[start, end]` array with the same numbers, set the `ranges` option\n-  to `true`.\n-\n-- **program**: It is possible to parse multiple files into a single\n-  AST by passing the tree produced by parsing the first file as the\n-  `program` option in subsequent parses. This will add the toplevel\n-  forms of the parsed file to the \"Program\" (top) node of an existing\n-  parse tree.\n-\n-- **sourceFile**: When the `locations` option is `true`, you can pass\n-  this option to add a `source` attribute in every node’s `loc`\n-  object. Note that the contents of this option are not examined or\n-  processed in any way; you are free to use whatever format you\n-  choose.\n-\n-- **directSourceFile**: Like `sourceFile`, but a `sourceFile` property\n-  will be added (regardless of the `location` option) directly to the\n-  nodes, rather than the `loc` object.\n-\n-- **preserveParens**: If this option is `true`, parenthesized expressions\n-  are represented by (non-standard) `ParenthesizedExpression` nodes\n-  that have a single `expression` property containing the expression\n-  inside parentheses.\n-\n-[range]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=745678\n-\n-**parseExpressionAt**`(input, offset, options)` will parse a single\n-expression in a string, and return its AST. It will not complain if\n-there is more of the string left after the expression.\n-\n-**getLineInfo**`(input, offset)` can be used to get a `{line,\n-column}` object for a given program string and character offset.\n-\n-**tokenizer**`(input, options)` returns an object with a `getToken`\n-method that can be called repeatedly to get the next token, a `{start,\n-end, type, value}` object (with added `loc` property when the\n-`locations` option is enabled and `range` property when the `ranges`\n-option is enabled). When the token's type is `tokTypes.eof`, you\n-should stop calling the method, since it will keep returning that same\n-token forever.\n-\n-In ES6 environment, returned result can be used as any other\n-protocol-compliant iterable:\n-\n-```javascript\n-for (let token of acorn.tokenizer(str)) {\n-  // iterate over the tokens\n-}\n-\n-// transform code to array of tokens:\n-var tokens = [...acorn.tokenizer(str)];\n-```\n-\n-**tokTypes** holds an object mapping names to the token type objects\n-that end up in the `type` properties of tokens.\n-\n-#### Note on using with [Escodegen][escodegen]\n-\n-Escodegen supports generating comments from AST, attached in\n-Esprima-specific format. In order to simulate same format in\n-Acorn, consider following example:\n-\n-```javascript\n-var comments = [], tokens = [];\n-\n-var ast = acorn.parse('var x = 42; // answer', {\n-\t// collect ranges for each node\n-\tranges: true,\n-\t// collect comments in Esprima's format\n-\tonComment: comments,\n-\t// collect token ranges\n-\tonToken: tokens\n-});\n-\n-// attach comments using collected information\n-escodegen.attachComments(ast, comments, tokens);\n-\n-// generate code\n-console.log(escodegen.generate(ast, {comment: true}));\n-// > 'var x = 42;    // answer'\n-```\n-\n-[escodegen]: https://github.com/estools/escodegen\n-\n-### dist/acorn_loose.js ###\n-\n-This file implements an error-tolerant parser. It exposes a single\n-function. The loose parser is accessible in node.js via `require(\"acorn/dist/acorn_loose\")`.\n-\n-**parse_dammit**`(input, options)` takes the same arguments and\n-returns the same syntax tree as the `parse` function in `acorn.js`,\n-but never raises an error, and will do its best to parse syntactically\n-invalid code in as meaningful a way as it can. It'll insert identifier\n-nodes with name `\"✖\"` as placeholders in places where it can't make\n-sense of the input. Depends on `acorn.js`, because it uses the same\n-tokenizer.\n-\n-### dist/walk.js ###\n-\n-Implements an abstract syntax tree walker. Will store its interface in\n-`acorn.walk` when loaded without a module system.\n-\n-**simple**`(node, visitors, base, state)` does a 'simple' walk over\n-a tree. `node` should be the AST node to walk, and `visitors` an\n-object with properties whose names correspond to node types in the\n-[ESTree spec][estree]. The properties should contain functions\n-that will be called with the node object and, if applicable the state\n-at that point. The last two arguments are optional. `base` is a walker\n-algorithm, and `state` is a start state. The default walker will\n-simply visit all statements and expressions and not produce a\n-meaningful state. (An example of a use of state is to track scope at\n-each point in the tree.)\n-\n-**ancestor**`(node, visitors, base, state)` does a 'simple' walk over\n-a tree, building up an array of ancestor nodes (including the current node)\n-and passing the array to the callbacks as a third parameter.\n-\n-**recursive**`(node, state, functions, base)` does a 'recursive'\n-walk, where the walker functions are responsible for continuing the\n-walk on the child nodes of their target node. `state` is the start\n-state, and `functions` should contain an object that maps node types\n-to walker functions. Such functions are called with `(node, state, c)`\n-arguments, and can cause the walk to continue on a sub-node by calling\n-the `c` argument on it with `(node, state)` arguments. The optional\n-`base` argument provides the fallback walker functions for node types\n-that aren't handled in the `functions` object. If not given, the\n-default walkers will be used.\n-\n-**make**`(functions, base)` builds a new walker object by using the\n-walker functions in `functions` and filling in the missing ones by\n-taking defaults from `base`.\n-\n-**findNodeAt**`(node, start, end, test, base, state)` tries to\n-locate a node in a tree at the given start and/or end offsets, which\n-satisfies the predicate `test`. `start` and `end` can be either `null`\n-(as wildcard) or a number. `test` may be a string (indicating a node\n-type) or a function that takes `(nodeType, node)` arguments and\n-returns a boolean indicating whether this node is interesting. `base`\n-and `state` are optional, and can be used to specify a custom walker.\n-Nodes are tested from inner to outer, so if two nodes match the\n-boundaries, the inner one will be preferred.\n-\n-**findNodeAround**`(node, pos, test, base, state)` is a lot like\n-`findNodeAt`, but will match any node that exists 'around' (spanning)\n-the given position.\n-\n-**findNodeAfter**`(node, pos, test, base, state)` is similar to\n-`findNodeAround`, but will match all nodes *after* the given position\n-(testing outer nodes before inner nodes).\n-\n-## Command line interface\n-\n-The `bin/acorn` utility can be used to parse a file from the command\n-line. It accepts as arguments its input file and the following\n-options:\n-\n-- `--ecma3|--ecma5|--ecma6|--ecma7`: Sets the ECMAScript version to parse. Default is\n-  version 5.\n-\n-- `--module`: Sets the parsing mode to `\"module\"`. Is set to `\"script\"` otherwise.\n-\n-- `--locations`: Attaches a \"loc\" object to each node with \"start\" and\n-  \"end\" subobjects, each of which contains the one-based line and\n-  zero-based column numbers in `{line, column}` form.\n-\n-- `--allow-hash-bang`: If the code starts with the characters #! (as in a shellscript), the first line will be treated as a comment.\n-\n-- `--compact`: No whitespace is used in the AST output.\n-\n-- `--silent`: Do not output the AST, just return the exit status.\n-\n-- `--help`: Print the usage information and quit.\n-\n-The utility spits out the syntax tree as JSON data.\n-\n-## Build system\n-\n-Acorn is written in ECMAScript 6, as a set of small modules, in the\n-project's `src` directory, and compiled down to bigger ECMAScript 3\n-files in `dist` using [Browserify](http://browserify.org) and\n-[Babel](http://babeljs.io/). If you are already using Babel, you can\n-consider including the modules directly.\n-\n-The command-line test runner (`npm test`) uses the ES6 modules. The\n-browser-based test page (`test/index.html`) uses the compiled modules.\n-The `bin/build-acorn.js` script builds the latter from the former.\n-\n-If you are working on Acorn, you'll probably want to try the code out\n-directly, without an intermediate build step. In your scripts, you can\n-register the Babel require shim like this:\n-\n-    require(\"babel-core/register\")\n-\n-That will allow you to directly `require` the ES6 modules.\n-\n-## Plugins\n-\n-Acorn is designed support allow plugins which, within reasonable\n-bounds, redefine the way the parser works. Plugins can add new token\n-types and new tokenizer contexts (if necessary), and extend methods in\n-the parser object. This is not a clean, elegant API—using it requires\n-an understanding of Acorn's internals, and plugins are likely to break\n-whenever those internals are significantly changed. But still, it is\n-_possible_, in this way, to create parsers for JavaScript dialects\n-without forking all of Acorn. And in principle it is even possible to\n-combine such plugins, so that if you have, for example, a plugin for\n-parsing types and a plugin for parsing JSX-style XML literals, you\n-could load them both and parse code with both JSX tags and types.\n-\n-A plugin should register itself by adding a property to\n-`acorn.plugins`, which holds a function. Calling `acorn.parse`, a\n-`plugins` option can be passed, holding an object mapping plugin names\n-to configuration values (or just `true` for plugins that don't take\n-options). After the parser object has been created, the initialization\n-functions for the chosen plugins are called with `(parser,\n-configValue)` arguments. They are expected to use the `parser.extend`\n-method to extend parser methods. For example, the `readToken` method\n-could be extended like this:\n-\n-```javascript\n-parser.extend(\"readToken\", function(nextMethod) {\n-  return function(code) {\n-    console.log(\"Reading a token!\")\n-    return nextMethod.call(this, code)\n-  }\n-})\n-```\n-\n-The `nextMethod` argument passed to `extend`'s second argument is the\n-previous value of this method, and should usually be called through to\n-whenever the extended method does not handle the call itself.\n-\n-Similarly, the loose parser allows plugins to register themselves via\n-`acorn.pluginsLoose`.  The extension mechanism is the same as for the\n-normal parser:\n-\n-```javascript\n-looseParser.extend(\"readToken\", function(nextMethod) {\n-  return function() {\n-    console.log(\"Reading a token in the loose parser!\")\n-    return nextMethod.call(this)\n-  }\n-})\n-```\n-\n-### Existing plugins\n-\n- - [`acorn-jsx`](https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx): Parse [Facebook JSX syntax extensions](https://github.com/facebook/jsx)\n- - [`acorn-es7-plugin`](https://github.com/MatAtBread/acorn-es7-plugin/): Parse [async/await syntax proposal](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait)\n- - [`acorn-object-spread`](https://github.com/UXtemple/acorn-object-spread): Parse [object spread syntax proposal](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread)\n- - [`acorn-es7`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acorn-es7): Parse [decorator syntax proposal](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators)\n- - [`acorn-objj`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acorn-objj): [Objective-J](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/learn/objective-j.html) language parser built as Acorn plugin"
