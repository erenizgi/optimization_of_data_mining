Instead only test\nthat the value is likely in the correct unit (seconds) and it should\nbe increasing in subsequent calls.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26206\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/26205\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26016\nReviewed-By: Anna Henningsen <anna@addaleax.net>\nReviewed-By: Rich Trott <rtrott@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Richard Lau <riclau@uk.ibm.com>",
