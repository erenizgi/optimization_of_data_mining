It assumes those server side\nevents occur before the client side write callback, which is not\nguaranteed by the TLS API. It usually passes with TLS1.3, but TLS1.3\ndidn't exist at the time the bug existed.\n\nPin the test to TLS1.2, since the test shouldn't be changed in a way that\ndoesn't trigger a segfault in 7.7.3:\n- https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/13184#issuecomment-303700377\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25508\nReviewed-By: Anna Henningsen <anna@addaleax.net>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>",
