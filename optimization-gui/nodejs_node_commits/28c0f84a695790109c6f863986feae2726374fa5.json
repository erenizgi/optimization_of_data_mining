They\n  land stuff on the master branch. Adding this material here is\n  confusing because it implies that Collaborators do land stuff on those\n  branches. Save talk about those branches and how they're managed for\n  later in the LTS section where it can be made clear that most\n  Collaborators should not be landing code there anyway.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25842\nReviewed-By: Michaël Zasso <targos@protonmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Richard Lau <riclau@uk.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>",
