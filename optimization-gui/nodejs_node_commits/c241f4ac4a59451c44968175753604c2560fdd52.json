It is used both\n+in development and in production in order to investigate problems.  The failure\n+of one of these tools may be as big a problem for an end user as a bug within\n+the runtime itself.\n+\n+The Node.js project has assessed the tools and the APIs which support those\n+tools. Each of the tools and APIs has been put into one of\n+the following tiers.\n+\n+* Tier 1 - Must always be working(CI tests passing) for all\n+  Current and LTS Node.js releases. A release will not be shipped if the test\n+  suite for the tool/API is not green. To be considered for inclusion\n+  in this tier it must have a good test suite and that test suite and a job\n+  must exist in the Node.js CI so that it can be run as part of the release\n+  process.  Tests on master will be run nightly when possible to provide\n+  early warning of potential issues.  No commit to the current and LTS\n+  release branches should break this tool/API if the next major release\n+  is within 1 month. In addition:\n+    * The maintainers of the tool must remain responsive when there\n+      are problems;\n+    * The tool must be actively used by the ecosystem;\n+    * The tool must be heavily depended on;\n+    * The tool must have a guide or other documentation in the Node.js GitHub\n+      organization or website;\n+    * The tool must be working on all supported platforms;\n+    * The tool must only be using APIs exposed by Nodejs as opposed to\n+      its dependencies; and\n+    * The tool must be open source.\n+\n+* Tier 2 - Must be working(CI tests passing) for all\n+  LTS releases. An LTS release will not be shipped if the test\n+  suite for the tool/API is not green. To be considered for inclusion\n+  in this tier it must have a good test suite and that test suite and a job\n+  must exist in the Node.js CI so that it can be run as part of the release\n+  process. In addition:\n+    * The maintainers of the tool must remain responsive when\n+      there are problems;\n+    * The tool must be actively used by the ecosystem;\n+    * The tool must be heavily depended on;\n+    * The tool must have a guide or other documentation in the Node.js GitHub\n+      organization or website;\n+    * The tool must be open source.\n+\n+ * Tier 3 - If possible its test suite\n+   will be run at least nightly in the Node.js CI and issues opened for\n+   failures.  Does not block shipping a release.\n+\n+ * Tier 4 - Does not block shipping a release.\n+\n+ * Unclassified - tool/API is new or does not have the required testing in the\n+   Node.js CI in order to qualify for a higher tier.\n+\n+The choice of which tier a particular tool will be assigned to, will be a\n+collaborative decision between Diagnostics WG and Release WG. Some of the\n+criteria considered might be:\n+\n+* If the tool fits into a key category as listed below.\n+* Whether the tool is actively used by the ecosystem.\n+* The availability of alternatives.\n+* Impact to the overall ecosystem if the tool is not working.\n+* The availability of reliable test suite that can be integrated into our CI.\n+* The availability of maintainer or community collaborator who will help\n+  resolve issues when there are CI failures.\n+* If the tool is maintained by the Node.js Foundation GitHub organization.\n+\n+The current categories of tools/APIs that fall under these Tiers are:\n+\n+* FFDC (F) - First failure data capture, easy to consume initial diagnostic\n+  information.\n+* Tracing (T) - use of logging to provide information about execution flow.\n+* Memory (M) - tools that provide additional information about memory\n+  used in the Heap or by native code.\n+* Profiling (P) - tools that provide additional information about where\n+  CPU cycles are being spent.\n+* AsyncFlow (A) - tools that provide additional insight into asynchronous\n+  execution flow.\n+\n+## Adding a tool to this list\n+\n+Any tool that might be used to investigate issues when running Node.js can\n+be added to the list. If there is a new tool that should be added to the\n+list, it should start by being added to the \"Not yet classified\" or\n+\"Tier 4\" lists. Once it has been added to the list \"promotion\" to Tier 3\n+through Tier 1 requires that the requirements listed above be met AND\n+have agreement from Diagnostics WG and Release WG based on the criteria\n+listed above.\n+\n+## Tiers\n+\n+The tools are currently assigned to Tiers as follows:\n+\n+## Tier 1\n+\n+ | Tool Type | Tool/API Name             | Regular Testing in Node.js CI | Integrated with Node.js | Target Tier |\n+ |-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n+ |           |                           |                               |                         |             |\n+\n+## Tier 2\n+\n+ | Tool Type | Tool/API Name             | Regular Testing in Node.js CI | Integrated with Node.js | Target Tier |\n+ |-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n+ |           |                           |                               |                         |             |\n+\n+\n+## Tier 3\n+\n+ | Tool Type | Tool/API Name             | Regular Testing in Node.js CI | Integrated with Node.js | Target Tier |\n+ |-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n+ |           |                           |                               |                         |             |\n+\n+## Tier 4\n+\n+ | Tool Type | Tool/API Name             | Regular Testing in Node.js CI | Integrated with Node.js | Target Tier |\n+ |-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n+ |           |                           |                               |                         |             |\n+\n+## Not yet classified\n+\n+ | Tool Type | Tool/API Name             | Regular Testing in Node.js CI | Integrated with Node.js | Target Tier |\n+ |-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n+ | FFDC      | node-report               | No                            | No                      |     1       |\n+ | Memory    | mdb_V8                    | No                            | No                      |     4       |\n+ | Memory    | node-heapdump             | No                            | No                      |     2       |\n+ | Memory    | V8 heap profiler          | No                            | Yes                     |     1       |\n+ | Memory    | V8 sampling heap profiler | No                            | Yes                     |     1       |\n+ | AsyncFlow | Async Hooks (API)         | ?                             | Yes                     |     1       |\n+ | Debugger  | V8 Debug protocol (API)   | No                            | Yes                     |     1       |\n+ | Debugger  | Command line Debug Client | ?                             | Yes                     |     1       |\n+ | Debugger  | llnode                    | ?                             | No                      |     2       |\n+ | Debugger  | Chrome Dev tools          | ?                             | No                      |     3       |\n+ | Debugger  | Chakracore - time-travel  | No                            | Data source only        | too early   |\n+ | Tracing   | trace_events (API)        | No                            | Yes                     |     1       |\n+ | Tracing   | DTrace                    | No                            | Partial                 |     3       |\n+ | Tracing   | LTTng                     | No                            | Removed?                |     N/A     |\n+ | Tracing   | ETW                       | No                            | Partial                 |     3       |\n+ | Tracing   | Systemtap                 | No                            | Partial                 |     ?       |\n+ | Profiling | V8 CPU profiler  (--prof) | No                            | Yes                     |     1       |\n+ | Profiling | Linux perf                | No                            | Partial                 |     ?       |\n+ | Profiling | DTrace                    | No                            | Partial                 |     3       |\n+ | Profiling | Windows Xperf             | No                            | ?                       |     ?       |\n+ | Profiling | 0x                        | No                            | No                      |     4       |\n+ | Profiling | node-clinic               | No                            | No                      | to early    |\n+ | F/P/T     | appmetrics                | No                            | No                      |     ?       |\n+ | M/T       | eBPF tracing tool         | No                            | No                      |     ?       |"
