    "message": "win: clarify Boxstarter behavior on install tools\n\nClarify the behavior of what Boxstarter may do when it runs on a box\nto install all the necessary tools so that there are no surprises to\nthe end user when the script is run.\n\nCurrently there is no interface that warns the user that Boxstarter\nwill reboot the machine possibly multiple times depending on how many\ndependencies need to be installed and doesn't mention a need to disable\nUAC. For folks who see what may look like a reboot loop, we feel it is\nnecessary to make them aware that UAC will be disabled and they will\nneed to take action to re-enable UAC manually if they interfere/stop\nthe script from finishing.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/23987\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/369\nReviewed-By: John-David Dalton <john.david.dalton@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Refael Ackermann <refack@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Richard Lau <riclau@uk.ibm.com>",
