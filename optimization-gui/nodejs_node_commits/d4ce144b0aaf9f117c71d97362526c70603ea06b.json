If it is still awaiting the\n-[minimum time to land](#waiting-for-approvals), please add the `author ready`\n-label to it so it is obvious that the PR can land as soon as the time ends.\n-\n-Where there is discussion amongst Collaborators, consensus should be sought if\n-possible. The lack of consensus may indicate the need to elevate discussion to\n-the TSC for resolution.\n-\n-If any Collaborator objects to a change *without giving any additional\n-explanation or context*, and the objecting Collaborator fails to respond to\n-explicit requests for explanation or context within a reasonable period of\n-time, the objection may be dismissed. Note that this does not apply to\n-objections that are explained.\n-\n-Note that breaking changes (that is, pull requests that require an increase in\n-the major version number, known as `semver-major` changes) must be [elevated for\n-review by the TSC](#involving-the-tsc). This does not necessarily mean that the\n-PR must be put onto the TSC meeting agenda. If multiple TSC members approve\n-(`LGTM`) the PR and no Collaborators oppose the PR, it should be landed.
