This potential instability is why Node.js offers\n-distinct Current and LTS release streams that offer explicit stability\n-guarantees.\n-\n-Specifically:\n-\n * Breaking changes should *never* land in Current or LTS except when:\n   * Resolving critical security issues.\n   * Fixing a critical bug (e.g. fixing a memory leak) requires a breaking"
