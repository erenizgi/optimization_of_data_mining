    "message": "doc: remove problematic example from README\n\nRemove Buffer constructor example from security reporting examples. Even\nthough the example text focuses on API compatibility, the pull request\ncited is about zero-filling vs. not zero-filling, which is not an API\ncompatibility change (or at least is not unambiguously one). The fact\nthat it's a pull request is also problematic, since it's not reporting a\nsecurity issue but instead proposing a way to address one that has\nalready been reported publicly. Finally, the text focuses on the fact\nthat it was not deemed worth of backporting, but that was determined by\na vote by a divided CTC. It is unreasonable to ask someone reporting an\nissue to make a determination that the CTC/TSC is divided on.\n\nIn short, it's not a good example for the list it is in. Remove it.\n\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/23759#discussion_r226804801\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/23817\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Michael Dawson <michael_dawson@ca.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Michaël Zasso <targos@protonmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>",
