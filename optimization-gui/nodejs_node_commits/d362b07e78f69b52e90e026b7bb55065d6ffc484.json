    "message": "test: move net bytes-per-chunk test to parallel\n\nThis was added in 3217e8e66fa81e787b9f3b18c0c09235f050acee as\na regression test for a security patch. We moved it to\n`sequential` to lower the risk of creating a flaky test,\nbecause an earlier version of it was failing one some platforms.\n\nThere is no known reason why te test should be flaky in this form,\nthough, and moving it to parallel would be good because it does take\naround 3 seconds that would otherwise fully count towards the\ntest run time.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21322\nReviewed-By: Rich Trott <rtrott@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ruben Bridgewater <ruben@bridgewater.de>",
