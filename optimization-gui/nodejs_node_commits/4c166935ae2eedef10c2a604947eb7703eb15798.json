An explicit notice indicating\n-  the deprecation status is added to the API documentation but no functional\n-  changes are implemented in the code. By default there will be no deprecation\n-  warnings emitted for such deprecations at runtime.

A command-line\n-  switch can be used to escalate such warnings into runtime errors that will\n-  cause the Node.js process to exit. As with Documentation-Only Deprecation,\n-  the documentation for the API must be updated to clearly indicate the\n-  deprecated status.\n-\n-* *End-of-life* refers to APIs that have gone through Runtime Deprecation and\n-  are no longer subject to the semantic versioning rules used by the project.\n+* *Documentation-Only Deprecation*: A deprecation notice is added to the API\n+  documentation but no functional changes are implemented in the code.
