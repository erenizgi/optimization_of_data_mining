    "message": "doc: leave pull requests open for 72 hours\n\nCurrently, we have a 48/72 rule for how many hours a pull request should\nbe left open at a minimum. Unfortunately, whether a pull request should\nbe left open for 48 or 72 hours is often unclear. The 72 hours is\nrequired if it is a weekend. If I open a pull request on a Friday\nmorning, does it need to stay open 48 hours or 72 or something in\nbetween? Does it matter if I'm in one time zone or another?\n\nThe 48/72 rule predates our fast-tracking process. Given the ability to\nfast-track trivial pull requests, there should be little disadvantage to\nleaving significant changes open for 72 hours instead of 48 hours, and\narguably considerable advantage in terms of allowing people sufficient\ntime to review things.\n\nSo to simplify, standardize on 72 hours. Weekend or not, 72 hours. Easy.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22275\nReviewed-By: John-David Dalton <john.david.dalton@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Сковорода Никита Андреевич <chalkerx@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Benjamin Gruenbaum <benjamingr@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Brian White <mscdex@mscdex.net>\nReviewed-By: Jon Moss <me@jonathanmoss.me>\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ben Coe <bencoe@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Sakthipriyan Vairamani <thechargingvolcano@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Refael Ackermann <refack@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: João Reis <reis@janeasystems.com>\nReviewed-By: Michael Dawson <michael_dawson@ca.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Rod Vagg <rod@vagg.org>",
