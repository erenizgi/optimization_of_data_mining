    "message": "doc: remove link prediction from STYLE_GUIDE.md\n\nRemove promise to eventually link an example document to show level-one\nheading. The style guide has been fine without the example doc for a\nlong time. The statement is already clear. And the style guide itself is\nan example. We don't link to examples of wrapping at 80 characters, for\nexample. There's no need to link just to show what a level-one heading\nis. (And if level-one heading is unclear, then it may be preferable to\nimprove the terminology rather than to link to an example.)\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21031\nReviewed-By: Richard Lau <riclau@uk.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Vse Mozhet Byt <vsemozhetbyt@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Tiancheng \"Timothy\" Gu <timothygu99@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>",
