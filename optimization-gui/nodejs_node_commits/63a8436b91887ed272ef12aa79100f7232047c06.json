However, as an\nadjective, as in \"backward compatibility\", only \"backward\" will do.\nEasiest solution: Always use \"backward\" because it is OK in both cases.\nThis is all compounded by the US vs UK English thing. US English tends\nto favor \"backward\", and we standardize on US English, so that's another\npoint in favor of \"backward\" over \"backwards\" in this context.)\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20519\nReviewed-By: Vse Mozhet Byt <vsemozhetbyt@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Refael Ackermann <refack@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ruben Bridgewater <ruben@bridgewater.de>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>",
