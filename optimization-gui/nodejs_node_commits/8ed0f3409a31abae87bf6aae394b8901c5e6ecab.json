Specify \"personal pronouns\" for clarity.\n* more colloquial -> colloquial\n* like -> such as\n* Remove \"mass nouns\" as no mass nouns are given as examples. Plural\n  nouns seems to be what was meant, so use that instead.\n* Repeat \"gender-neutral\" to make it clear that it refers to both terms\n  and not merely the first term it appears before.\n* Remove \"non-comprehensive examples\". Examples are, by definition,\n  non-comprehensive. No need to announce that the examples are examples.\n  It is obvious.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19269\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>",
