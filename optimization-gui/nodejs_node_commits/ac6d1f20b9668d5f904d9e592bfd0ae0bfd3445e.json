    "message": "doc: remove squash guideline from onboarding doc\n\nAlthough I agree with the guideline people should generally not squash\ncommits in a pull request until the end (in other words, until it's time\nto land the PR), it is clear from comments and actions in the issue\ntracker that many do not share that view. This is fine by me, but I do\nthink that we should our documentation should reflect our practices\nrather than being an aspirational statement.\n\nIf we *do* wish to preserve this recommendation, it probably belongs in\nanother document anyway as this is not a recommendation for\nCollaborators only but for anyone opening a pull request.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20413\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>",
