    "message": "test: remove test case 0 from tls-cnnic-whitelist\n\nI looks like this test has not worked as expected since commit\n2bc7841d0fcdd066fe477873229125b6f003b693 (\"test: use random ports\nwhere possible\"). The test in that commit checked for `CERT_REVOKED`\nwhich was returned by CheckWhitelistedServerCert.\n\nCheckWhitelistedServerCert was later removed in commit\ndc875438a3953102febffa79b691317bb24ba2aa (\"src: drop CNNIC+StartCom\ncertificate whitelisting\").\n\nI'm suggesting that this test case be removed as I don't think it is\nvalid anymore.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19767\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>",
