    "message": "doc: shorten character encoding introduction\n\nKeep the introduction for Buffers and character encodings short and to\nthe point. The current introduction doesn't provide much in the way of\nuseful additional information, but it is a bit confusing in its wording.\n(\"such as\" seems like it ought to refer to \"encoded characters\" but it\nactually refers to character encodings, which are not mentioned in the\nsentence. It may be arguable as to whether \"hex-encoded\" is in fact a\ncharacter encoding, whether it should be stylized as \"Hex-encoded\" or\nnot, and whether it should be spelled out as \"Hexadecimal-encoded\". None\nof that information is particularly useful to the end user at this point\nin the text. Omitting it simplifies and improves the documentation.)\n\nAdditionally, the section is now wrapped to 80 characters.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19648\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Gireesh Punathil <gpunathi@in.ibm.com>\nReviewed-By: Tiancheng \"Timothy\" Gu <timothygu99@gmail.com>",
