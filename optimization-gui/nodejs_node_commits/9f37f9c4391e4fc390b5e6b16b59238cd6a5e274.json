A rule of\n-thumb is to base the determination off what functionality is actually\n-documented in the official Node.js API documentation. However, it has been\n-repeatedly demonstrated that either the documentation does not completely cover\n-implemented behavior or that Node.js users have come to rely heavily on\n-undocumented aspects of the Node.js implementation.\n-\n-The following general rules should be followed to determine which aspects of the\n-Node.js API are internal:\n-\n-- All functionality exposed via `process.binding(...)` is internal.\n-- All functionality implemented in `lib/internal/**/*.js` is internal unless it\n-  is re-exported by code in `lib/*.js` or documented as part of the Node.js\n-  Public API.\n-- Any object property or method whose key is a non-exported `Symbol` is an\n-  internal property.\n-- Any object property or method whose key begins with the underscore `_` prefix\n-  is internal unless it is documented as part of the Node.js Public API.\n-- Any object, property, method, argument, behavior, or event not documented in\n-  the Node.js documentation is internal.\n-- Any native C/C++ APIs/ABIs exported by the Node.js `*.h` header files that\n-  are hidden behind the `NODE_WANT_INTERNALS` flag are internal.\n-\n-Exceptions can be made if use or behavior of a given internal API can be\n-demonstrated to be sufficiently relied upon by the Node.js ecosystem such that\n-any changes would cause too much breakage. The threshold for what qualifies as\n-too much breakage is to be decided on a case-by-case basis by the TSC.\n-\n-If it is determined that a currently undocumented object, property, method,\n-argument, or event *should* be documented, then a pull request adding the\n-documentation is required in order for it to be considered part of the public\n-API.\n-\n-Making a determination about whether something *should* be documented can be\n-difficult and will need to be handled on a case-by-case basis. For instance, if\n-one documented API cannot be used successfully without the use of a second\n-*currently undocumented* API, then the second API *should* be documented. If\n-using an API in a manner currently undocumented achieves a particular useful\n-result, a decision will need to be made whether or not that falls within the\n-supported scope of that API; and if it does, it should be documented.\n-\n-See [Breaking Changes to Internal Elements](#breaking-changes-to-internal-elements)\n-on how to handle those types of changes.\n+All functionality in the official Node.js documentation is part of the public\n+API. Any undocumented object, property, method, argument, behavior, or event is\n+internal. There are exceptions to this rule. Node.js users have come to rely on\n+some undocumented behaviors. Collaborators treat many of those undocumented\n+behaviors as public.\n+\n+All undocumented functionality exposed via  `process.binding(...)` is internal.\n+\n+All undocumented functionality in `lib/internal/**/*.js` is internal. It is\n+public, though, if it is re-exported by code in `lib/*.js`.\n+\n+Non-exported `Symbol` properties and methods are internal.\n+\n+Any undocumented object property or method that begins with `_` is internal.\n+\n+Any native C/C++ APIs/ABIs requiring the `NODE_WANT_INTERNALS` flag are\n+internal.\n+\n+Sometimes, there is disagreement about whether functionality is internal or\n+public. In those cases, the TSC makes a determination.\n+\n+For undocumented APIs that are public, open a pull request documenting the API.\n \n ### Breaking Changes\n "
