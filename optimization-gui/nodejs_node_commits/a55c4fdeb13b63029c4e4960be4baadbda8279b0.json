    "message": "doc: remove unclear text from fs.write()\n\nThere is a paragraph explaining that `fs.write()` cannot write a\nsubstring of the provided string. It's not clear what `buffer` refers\nto in that paragraph or even what the purpose of the paragraph is.\nThere's no suggestion elsewhere that `fs.write()` should be expected to\nhave a substring feature. Remove the paragraph.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20450\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Vse Mozhet Byt <vsemozhetbyt@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Tobias Nießen <tniessen@tnie.de>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>",

Note that\n bytes written is not the same as string characters. See [`Buffer.byteLength`][].\n \n-Unlike when writing `buffer`, the entire string must be written. No substring\n-may be specified. This is because the byte offset of the resulting data may not\n-be the same as the string offset.\n-\n Note that it is unsafe to use `fs.write` multiple times on the same file\n without waiting for the callback. For this scenario,\n `fs.createWriteStream` is strongly recommended."
