    "message": "doc: improve Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow() and related\n\n* Fixed \"cleanup\" being misused as a verb\n* \"Use of Foo should only be used\" construction changed to \"Foo should\n  only be used...\"\n* Otherwise-unmentioned \"`Persistent`\" changed to more understandable\n  \"persistent\"\n* remove an instance of unnecessary italics\n* wrap at 80 characters\n\nChange all \"initialize a...instance to zeroes\" to say \"with zeroes\"\ninstead. Previously, both formulations appeared.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19742\nReviewed-By: Vse Mozhet Byt <vsemozhetbyt@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>",
