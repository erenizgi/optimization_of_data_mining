For example: [v4.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v4.x).\n-  The major version number of Current releases will increment every 6 months\n-  allowing for breaking changes to be introduced. This happens in April and\n-  October every year. Current release lines beginning in October each year have\n-  a maximum support life of 8 months. Current release lines beginning in April\n-  each year will convert to LTS (see below) after 6 months and receive further\n-  support for 30 months.\n+## Release Types \n+\n+* **Current**: Under active development.

Every second Current release line (major version) will become an\n-  LTS line and receive 18 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 12\n-  months of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines are given alphabetically\n-  ordered codenames, beginning with v4 Argon. LTS releases are less frequent\n-  and will attempt to maintain consistent major and minor version numbers,\n-  only incrementing patch version numbers. There are no breaking changes or\n-  feature additions, except in some special circumstances.\n-* **Nightly**: Versions of code in this repository on the current Current\n-  branch, automatically built every 24-hours where changes exist.
