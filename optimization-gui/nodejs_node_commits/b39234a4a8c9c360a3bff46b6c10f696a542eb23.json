(For my local\n  setup, test-keep-alive seems to cause this test to fail with ETIMEDOUT\n  and/or EADDRNOTAVAIL. It would seem to be a result of throttling.\n  Reducing the pummel-iness of that test and this one seems to solve the\n  problem.)\n* Apply capitalization and punctuation to comment.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25485\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Ruben Bridgewater <ruben@bridgewater.de>",
