    "message": "doc: remove \"idiomatic choice\" from queueMicrotask\n\nIt can't be idiomatic if it's not in general use and therefore hasn't\nbeen picked up by users. It's not even in browsers yet.\n\n\"Idiomatic\" use is an emergent property that comes from observed use\nand this feature is so new (to browsers and Node) that it can't\npossibly be. In general I don't think it's the place of the Node API\ndocs to observe what emerges as idiomatic Node.js.\n\nIt also can't be a recommended feature (if that was the intent of the\nlanguage) because it's marked experimental. For now, it's just a\nfeature, nothing more. Recommendations and/or observations about it\nbeing 'idiomatic' can come later.\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/23885\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Rich Trott <rtrott@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Anna Henningsen <anna@addaleax.net>\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Tiancheng \"Timothy\" Gu <timothygu99@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Colin Ihrig <cjihrig@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Yuta Hiroto <hello@hiroppy.me>\nReviewed-By: Matheus Marchini <mat@mmarchini.me>\nReviewed-By: Vse Mozhet Byt <vsemozhetbyt@gmail.com>\nReviewed-By: Trivikram Kamat <trivikr.dev@gmail.com>",
