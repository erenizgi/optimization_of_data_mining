These owners may\n+contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\n+further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\n+reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\n+efforts of others.\n+\n+For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\n+of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\n+Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\n+and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\n+and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\n+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\n+effect of CC0 on those rights.\n+\n+1.

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n+applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n+unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\n+and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n+known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n+action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n+duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n+extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n+copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n+commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\").
